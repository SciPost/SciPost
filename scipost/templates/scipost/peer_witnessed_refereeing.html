    <h1>SciPost's Peer Review Method: Peer-Witnessed Refereeing.</h1>
  </div>
  <h3>Reporting</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Reports are gathered from editorially-invited referees, but can also be volunteered by registered SciPost Contributors during refereeing rounds.</li>
    <li>Reports are posted online (after rapid editorial vetting) on the Submission's Page, and can be replied to (Authors only) or commented on by all Contributors.</li>
    <li>Anonymity can be preserved at all meaningful stages if desired (you can e.g. elect to remain anonymous on a given Report, but named on another).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Contributors thus have additional incentives to actively participate and provide not only high-quality Submissions, but also Reports and Comments of the highest achievable professional caliber.</p>
  <p>Abusive behaviour is prevented by Editorial vetting of all Reports, Replies and Comments before public posting.</p>
