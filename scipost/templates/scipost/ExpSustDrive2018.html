      Since our original <a href="{% url 'scipost:call' %}" target="_blank">call for openness</a> in scientific publishing, things have been developing extremely well with SciPost. One quick glance at our <a href="{% url 'journals:publications' %}" target="_blank">publishing activities</a> (our list of publications now numbers more than 100, including some very highly-cited ones) is hopefully enough to convince you that we are well on our way to implementing a more healthy infrastructure for scientific publishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Separately, in a sure sign that <i>The Times They Are A Changin'</i>, big players are moving towards implementing Open Access very similarly to our vision (including the European Commission with its recent <a href="https://ted.europa.eu/udl?uri=TED:NOTICE:141558-2018:TEXT:EN:HTML&tabId=1" target="_blank">Call for Tenders</a>, though you should read recent blog posts <a href="https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/04/02/ectender/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/04/27/ECTenderInterview/" target="_blank">here</a> for how this relates to SciPost).
    </p>
    <p>
      The time is now ripe for us to be bold, and take the next steps in our implementation plans. Read on to see how you can significantly help us out.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">Going for Genuine Open Access</h3>
    <p>
      At SciPost, our ambitions for Open Access publishing are uncompromised, as can be seen from our <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#guiding_principles" target="_blank">guiding principles</a> or our short <a href="https://youtu.be/Pgvd7EvehCI" target="_blank">intro video</a>. In particular, we implement the <a href="https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2018/05/05/genuine-open-access/" target="_blank">Genuine Open Access</a> principles (which include an explicit non profit requirement), are resolutely quality-oriented and international in outlook.
    </p>
    <h4>The two pillars of our expansion and sustainability drive</h4>
    <p>
      Our immediate expansion plan is very simply summarized in the following two pillars:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Expansion of our <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#editorial_college_physics">Editorial College</a>,</li>
      <li>Expansion of our <a href="{% url 'partners:partners' %}" target="_blank">Supporting Partners</a> Board.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The first aims to ensure we can process the increasing editorial workflow. The second aims to ensure that we can continue running the infrastructure supporting all our operations.
    </p>
    <h3 class="highlight">How you can help</h3>
    <p>
      Are you sympathetic towards what we are aiming to achieve? You can help us accelerate our growth with these easy steps:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><i>Is your field insufficiently represented in our current <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#editorial_college_physics">Editorial College</a>?</i><br/>We are looking for world-class researchers to become Fellows. Send us your nominations at <a href="mailto:admin@scipost.org">admin@scipost.org</a>.<br/>We also welcome nominations in fields beyond Physics.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><i>Is your institution not listed on our <a href="{% url 'partners:partners' %}" target="_blank">Partners page</a>?</i><br/>Encourage them (through a librarian, Open Access officer, director, ...) to join by <a href="{% url 'petitions:petition' slug='join-SPB' %}" target="_blank">signing our petition</a>, and by personally emailing them directly using this <a href="mailto:?subject=Petition to support SciPost&body={% autoescape on %}{% include 'petitions/petition_email.html' %}{% endautoescape %}&cc=partners@scipost.org">email template</a>.</li>
      <br/>
      <li><i>Are your surroundings not yet sufficiently aware of SciPost?</i><br/>You can point them to our <a href="https://youtu.be/Pgvd7EvehCI" target="_blank">intro video</a> and mention this drive on social media using the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SwitchToSciPost">#SwitchToSciPost</a> hashtag.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      We will keep you continuously updated on the results from this Expansion and Sustainability Drive 2018 on our website, and via our <a href="{% url 'news:news' %}">News page</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many thanks in advance for your help.
    </p>
    <p>
      On behalf of the SciPost foundation,
