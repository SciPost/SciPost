      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us. Stichting SciPost, Ltd. (“SciPost”) operates a Website at scipost.org. It is SciPost’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Web sites.</p>

      <h2>Website visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most Website operators, SciPost collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that Web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SciPost’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SciPost’s visitors use its Website. From time to time, SciPost may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website. SciPost also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our site. SciPost only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrator.</p>

      <h2>Gathering of personally identifying information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to SciPost’s Websites choose to interact with SciPost in ways that require SciPost to gather personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that SciPost gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, SciPost operates a permission-based email communication system, which allows us to collect personal information and send emails to people who want to receive them. In each case, SciPost collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SciPost. SciPost does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities.</p>

      <h2>Aggregated statistics</h2>
      <p>SciPost may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Websites. SciPost may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SciPost does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.</p>

      <h2>Registered Contributors</h2>
      <p>Registered Contributors to SciPost agree that the Comments they submit for posting may appear online carrying an identifier including their full names. Additionally, Reports which are provided by Contributors who optionally elect to forego anonymity at the moment of the Report submission, will carry such an identifier if they are posted online. SciPost hosts an information page for each registered Contributor, including name, ORCID identifier, affiliation and link to personal web page, together with a list of Articles, Submissions, Commentaries and Comments associated to this Contributor. </p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a Website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Website each time the visitor returns. SciPost uses cookies to help SciPost identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their Website access preferences. SciPost visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using SciPost’s Websites, with the drawback that certain features of SciPost’s Websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. You can modify your browser settings to notify you each time a cookie is sent to it and you can decide whether or not to accept. Alternatively, you can set your browser to refuse all cookies. Cookies that have already been set can be deleted at any time using your browser settings. The independent website at www.aboutcookies.org contains comprehensive information on how to modify your browser settings.</p>

      <h2>Privacy policy changes</h2>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, SciPost may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and at SciPost’s sole discretion. SciPost encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
