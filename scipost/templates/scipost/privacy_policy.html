      <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please contact us. Stichting SciPost, Ltd. (“SciPost”) operates a Website at scipost.org. It is SciPost’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our Web sites.</p>

      <h2>Website visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most Website operators, SciPost collects non-personally identifying information of the sort that Web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SciPost’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SciPost’s visitors use its Website. From time to time, SciPost may release non-personally identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its Website. SciPost also collects potentially personally identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on our site. SciPost only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrator.</p>

      <h2>Gathering of personally identifying information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to SciPost’s Websites choose to interact with SciPost in ways that require SciPost to gather personally identifying information. The amount and type of information that SciPost gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, SciPost operates a permission-based email communication system, which allows us to collect personal information and send emails to people who want to receive them. In each case, SciPost collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfil the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with SciPost. SciPost does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Website-related activities.</p>

      <h2>Aggregated statistics</h2>
      <p>SciPost may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its Websites. SciPost may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SciPost does not disclose personally identifying information other than as described below.</p>

<!--
      <h2>Protection of certain personally identifying information</h2>
      <p>SciPost discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on SciPost’s behalf or to provide services available at SciPost’s Websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using SciPost’s Websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. SciPost will not rent or sell potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, SciPost discloses potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when SciPost believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of SciPost, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of SciPost and have supplied your email address, SciPost may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with SciPost and our activities – based on the preferences expressed at email sign-up. SciPost takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally identifying and personally identifying information.</p>

      <h2>Cookies</h2>
      <p>A cookie is a string of information that a Website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the Website each time the visitor returns. SciPost uses cookies to help SciPost identify and track visitors, their usage of the Website, and their Website access preferences.

      <h2>Business transfers</h2>
      <p>If SciPost, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that SciPost goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information will be one of the assets that is likely to be transferred to, or acquired by, a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and you consent to SciPost's transferring your user information to any acquirer of SciPost and their continuing to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
