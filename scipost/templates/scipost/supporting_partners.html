  <p>The set of all Supporting Partners forms the SciPost Supporting Partners Board (SPB). Acting as a representative body, the SPB’s purpose is to provide the main financial backing without which SciPost could not continue carrying out its mission, to counsel it in all its operations and to help determine the initiative’s development priorities.</p>

  <p>Interested parties can join the SciPost Supporting Partners Board by signing a <a href="{% static 'scipost/SPB/SciPost_Supporting_Partner_Agreement.pdf' %}">Partner Agreement</a>.</p>

  <p>Membership can be requested by filling the <a href="{% url 'scipost:SPB_membership_request' %}">online request form</a>.</p>
