<h3>What is SciPost?</h3>
<p>SciPost is a complete online publication portal managed by and for scientists.</p>
<p>
    Preprint handling and circulation occurs through the well-established arXiv;
    the rest of the publication process, from peer refereeing through publication
    all the way to post-publication commenting, is offered by SciPost.
</p>
<p>
    Thus, simply stated: share your preprint on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.arxiv.org">arXiv</a>, publish it in <a href="https://scipost.org">SciPost</a>.
</p><!-- End SciPost -->

            <p>This is a short summary; for a more detailed description, see our <a href="{% url 'submissions:sub_and_ref_procedure' %}">submission and refereeing procedure</a>.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Reports are gathered from editorially-invited referees, but can also be volunteered by registered SciPost Contributors during refereeing rounds.</li>
                <li>Reports are posted online (after rapid editorial vetting) on the Submission's Page, and can be replied to (privilege of Authors only) or commented on by all Contributors.</li>
                <li>Anonymity can be preserved at all meaningful stages if desired (as a referee, you can choose to remain anonymous on a particular Report, but named on another).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Contributors thus have additional incentives to actively participate and provide not only high-quality Submissions,
            but also Reports and Comments of the highest achievable professional caliber.
            Quality is moreover promoted by Editorial vetting of all Reports, Replies and Comments before public posting.</p>
