    <h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
    <div class="col-5">
      <h3>Why should I submit my manuscripts to SciPost?</h3>
      <p>Because:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>you think your work can withstand the stringest form of pre-publication scrutiny: <a href="{% url 'scipost:peer_witnessed_refereeing' %}">peer-witnessed refereeing</a></li>
	<li>you want your referees to have to adhere to the same standards of professionalism which are expected of you as an author</li>
	<li>you want all steps of the editorial process to be handled by professional scientists, not non-specialist journal staff editors</li>
	<li>you want your published work to be openly accessible and not hidden behind a paywall</li>
	<li>you do not think publishers should exploit your work for profit-making</li>
	<li>you do not think that author(s) should be paying publication costs</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h3>Will my SciPost publications be citable?</h3>
      <p>All SciPost publications will obtain a unique DOI, enabling citations and metrics as per other journals.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Who is behind SciPost?</h3>
      <ul>
	<li>SciPost was founded by <a href="http://staff.fnwi.uva.nl/j.s.caux">J.-S. Caux</a>, Professor of Theoretical Physics at the University of Amsterdam.</li>
	<li>The legal entity behind SciPost is Stichting SciPost, a not-for-profit Foundation established in Amsterdam. Its (non-remunerated) personnel consists in Prof. J.-S. Caux (chairman), Dr J. van Mameren (secretary) and Dr J. van Wezel (treasurer). </li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h3>Why was SciPost started?</h3>
      <p>The publishing landscape is evolving rapidly, and it is not clear that the best interests of science and scientists are being represented. SciPost aims to implement a grassroots solution by scientists, designed in the best interests of science itself, to the challenge of scientific publishing.</p> 
      <br/>
      <h3>Which fields of science does SciPost cater to?</h3>
      <p>The initial rollout of SciPost offers a Physics portal.</p>
      <p>Portals in other fields of science will be opened if the SciPost model proves to be successful.</p>

    <div class="col-5">
      <h3>Why should I become an active Contributor?</h3>
      <p>Because:</p>
      <ul>
	<li>you subscribe to the values underlining SciPost's <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}">guiding principles</a></li>
	<li>you would like your arduous refereeing and commenting work to be recognized and credited</li>
	<li>you would like to be entitled to report on submissions, even if you haven't been explicitly invited to do so by an editor</li>
	<li>you are interested in building useful extra content (comments, rederivations, etc) on existing literature</li>
	<li>you are willing to make your contributions as author and (anonymously) as reviewer and commenter openly accessible</li>
      </ul>
      <br/>
      <h3>How is SciPost funded?</h3>
      <p>SciPost operates non-commercially, encurring minimal costs. Contributors provide all the content and perform all editorial tasks as part of their normal institutional academic duties. Operations are kept running by a team of officers, themselves academically employed.</p>
      <p>Support for operational costs is initially provided by the <a href="http://www.nwo.nl/en">NWO</a> in the Netherlands. Long-term operations will be financed by donations from national funding agencies, universities, foundations and individuals.</p>
      <br/>
      <h3>Should I be worried about the long-term viability of SciPost?</h3>
      <p>If you are a generous private funder, then yes, for the sole reason that this will motivate you to support our operations.</p>
      <p>If you are a Contributor, there is no worry to be had. SciPost is from the outset established as a long-term operation and has no plans to shut down.</p>
      <h3>What will happen to my papers if SciPost disappers?</h3>
      <p>See the previous question/answer. In particular, authors should in no way worry that their SciPost publications could potentially disappear. This would require the dismantling not only of SciPost, but also of the arXiv (where the final version of the accepted SciPost papers (with unique DOI identifier) can be posted by the authors, and (since the papers are not behind a paywall) of the authors' own web pages. As long as the Web stands, SciPost stands.</p>
