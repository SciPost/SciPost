        <h1 class="highlight">SciPost Editorial Colleges By-laws</h1>

	<p>
	  Functioning of the SciPost Editorial Colleges is governed by the following set of by-laws.
	</p>
	<p>
	  These complement and are subsidiary to the legal statutes of Stichting SciPost
	  (hereafter: the Foundation).

    <li><strong>Editorial Colleges and their Composition</strong><a href="javascript:;" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="toggle" data-target="#Composition">view/hide</a>
      <div id="Composition" class="py-2" style="display: none;">
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>The Colleges</strong>
	    <p>
	      An Editorial College is formed for each field of the sciences in which SciPost
	      carries out publishing activities. The Editorial College of a certain field, composed of a collection of Fellows, takes end
	      responsibility for editorial matters for all Journals operating in that field.
	      For interdisciplinary submissions, the services of Fellows from distinct Colleges can be called
	      upon during the evaluation process.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Eligibility</strong>
	    <p>
	      Fellows of an Editorial College must be professionally active academics
	      with a permanent position of at least associate professor level or equivalent
	      at a recognized university or research institute. They must possess an extensive
	      publication record demonstrating world-leading research capabilities in at least one
	      stated subject area covered by SciPost Journals falling under the Editorial College concerned. There is no age limitation.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      <em>Guest Fellows</em>, whose services can be called upon for Commons- of Proceedings-class journals, should be professionally active academics with a position equivalent to junior faculty at a recognized university or research institute. The must possess a solid publication record demonstrating international-level research capabilities in at least one stated subject area covered by SciPost Journals falling under the Editorial College concerned. There is no age limitation. Guest Fellows are only given editorial tasks for specific submissions, and are not officially part of the Editorial College.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Number of Fellows</strong>
	    <p>
	      The size of an Editorial College will be such that each stated subject area
	      will be represented by at least 8 Fellows. There is no maximum.
	      The number of Fellows
	      caring for a stated subject area shall be adjusted to ensure a workload per Fellow
	      limited to approximately one half-day per month on average.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Appointment</strong>
	    <p>SciPost's Editorial Colleges should be representative of their respective academic communities. They are meant to be self-sustaining in scale and composition.</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Direct appointment by the Foundation
		<p>
		  If the number of Fellows in a stated specialty is below the required minimum number,
		  or if the number of currently available Fellows in a stated specialty
		  has diminished to a level where processing of Submissions becomes delayed,
		  the Foundation has the right to directly nominate and immediately appoint
		  individuals deemed to fulfil the eligibility criteria.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Appointment by election
		<p>
		  Foundation board members, members of the Advisory Board as well as current and past
		  Fellows of an Editorial College can nominate candidates for an Editorial Fellowship.
		  In addition, guest Fellows which have proved to be reliable Editors-in-charge
		  for <em>Commons</em>- or <em>Proceedings</em>-class Submissions can also be
		  nominated by Editorial Administration on behalf of the Foundation.
		  Candidates must fulfil the eligiblity criteria.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	    <p>
	      These nominations shall be forwarded to the relevant Editorial College
	      for voting, at the latest at the next Virtual General Meeting.
	      If a candidate secures a positive vote from at least three quarters
	      of the Fellows currently
	      caring for the candidate's stated main expertise, and if no veto is received from
	      Fellows in other subject areas, from the Advisory Board or from the Foundation's
	      Board, then the candidate is deemed elected, and is invited to join by the
	      Foundation. Appointment to an Editorial College starts immediately upon receipt
	      of a positive answer from the candidate.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Duration</strong>
	    <p>
	      An appointment as Fellow of an Editorial College is in principle for a period of two years.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Visibility</strong>
	    <p>
	      The composition of an Editorial College is publicly known. The list of Editorial
	      Fellows and their stated expertises is published on the website.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Renewal</strong>
	    <p>
	      An appointment is renewable without limitation. A Fellow coming to the end of
	      an appointment is automatically put up for re-election, unless
	      the said Fellow has informed the Foundation of his/her desire not to renew,
	      or if the Foundation or the Advisory Board vetoes the renewal.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>End of appointment</strong>
	    <p>
	      Appointment as an Editorial Fellow immediately ends upon:
	      <ul>
		<li>the Fellow informing the Foundation of his/her wish to cease
		  his/her Fellowship</li>
		<li>the Fellow ceasing to fulfil the eligibility criteria</li>
		<li>the Foundation terminating the appointment due to
		  conduct which it deems to be improper or in
		  conflict with the general aims and guiding principles of the Foundation.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
    </li>

    <hr>
    <li><strong>Meetings</strong> <a href="javascript:;" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="toggle" data-target="#Meetings">view/hide</a>
      <div id="Meetings" class="py-2" style="display: none;">
	<p>
	  Editorial Colleges, consisting of internationally-renowned scientists with a broad
	  geographic distribution, do not physically meet. Meetings are instead organized
	  using online facilities.
	</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Virtual General Meetings</strong>
	    <p>Once per year, Fellows of the Editorial Colleges are asked to participate in a
	      virtual general meeting. The meeting is organized by the Foundation and takes
	      place over the course of one week during the month of January.</p>
	    <p>For the VGM, a special web page is activated, which is accessible only to
	      Fellows, members of the Advisory Board and Foundation Board members.
	      This page contains items and points of discussion put forward by
	      the Foundation, Advisory Board and Editorial Fellows,
	      and can be consulted and acted upon by Board members and Fellows at
	      their own leisure during the week of the meeting.
	      The meeting is chaired by the Foundation's chairman.
	      During the week of the meeting, Fellows are able to comment on individual items and
	      bring forth motions for voting.
	      Re-elections, new nominations to the College and suggested amendments
	      to the By-laws must appear among the items at the meeting.</p>
	    <p>At the end of the week, the meeting is closed, and motions are put forward
	      for voting, which is open online for one week after the end of the VGM.</p>
	    <p>Within one week following the end of voting, the Foundation sets to work
	      implementing the decisions taken
	      and releases the minutes of the VGM to the Advisory Board and Editorial College.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Extraordinary Virtual Meetings</strong>
	    <p>At any time, the Foundation can call an Extraordinary Virtual Meeting, to
	      discuss pressing issues. This meeting must be
	      announced at least one week before its scheduled start.
	      An EVM otherwise follows the same procedures as a VGM.
	      </p>

    </li>

    <hr>
    <li><strong>Submissions processing</strong> <a href="javascript:;" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="toggle" data-target="#SubmissionsProcessing">view/hide</a>
      <div id="SubmissionsProcessing" class="py-2" style="display: none;">
	<p>The primary responsibility of the Editorial Colleges is to run the editorial process
	  for all SciPost Journals. The Colleges shall strive for the very highest standards of
	  professionalism achievable in the refereeing process.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li><strong>Submissions pool</strong>
	    <p>
	      Incoming Submissions are added to the field-specific pool of manuscripts
	      under consideration for publication.
	      This pool is visible to all members of the relevant Editorial College (with the
	      exception of Fellows flagged for potential conflict of interest with the authors
	      or the contents of the incoming Submission),
	      as well as to the Advisory Board and Foundation.
	      Each item in the pool represents a single Submission's whole history, including
	      possible earlier (pre-resubmission) versions.</p>
	    <p>
	      Submissions in the pool can be in any of the following stages:
	      <ul>
		<li>Pre-screening</li>
		<li>Screening</li>
		<li>Editor-in-charge appointed</li>
		<li>Refereeing round open</li>
		<li>Refereeing round closed</li>
		<li>Editorial Recommendation formulated</li>
		<li>Awaiting resubmission</li>
		<li>Editorial College decision pending</li>
		<li>Rejected</li>
		<li>Accepted and in production</li>
		<li>Published</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Pre-screening</strong>
	    <p>
	      For each Submission added to the pool, a thorough plagiarism check is performed
	      by SciPost's Editorial Administration. Appropriate action (immediate rejection;
	      request to authors for modified version) is taken if necessary. A thorough scan
	      is performed to flag potential conflicts of interest of authors with Fellows,
	      and a list of potential Editors-in-charge is preselected based on expertise and
	      availability.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Special provisions exist for certain classes of Journals:
	      <ul>
		<li>for <em>Commons</em>-class Journals, Editors-in-charge can
		  be preselected not only from current Fellows, but from well-respected members of the
		  community at large (in which case they become guest Fellows).</li>
		<li>for <em>Proceedings</em>-class Journals, Editors-in-charge are normally
		  preselected from the guest Fellows selected by the proceedings convenors
		  (in normal circumstances the conference/workshop organizers).</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Screening</strong>
	    <p>
	      The preselected Fellows are sent an assignment request to become Editor-in-charge.
	      Other Fellows within the Editorial College do not receive an assignment request but
	      can still view a Submission's details and volunteer to become Editor-in-charge
	      through their visibility rights on the Submissions pool.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Each assigned Fellow can explicitly decline the assignment, stating a reason among:
	      <em>too busy</em>, <em>conflict of interest</em>, <em>insufficiently qualified</em>
	      or <em>not interested</em>.
	      If the preselected list of Fellows empties and the submission has still not been
	      taken charge of, the preselection list is extended and new assignment requests
	      are sent to different Fellows.
	      If 5 assignments are declined citing <em>lack of interest</em>, the Submission is returned
	      to the authors and not considered for further processing towards publication.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Editorial College must make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the pre-screening process
	      be completed within 5 working days starting from the moment of submission.
	      If this proves impossible (for example due to a large influx of Submissions and current
	      unavailability of specialist Fellows), the authors are informed of the delay and
	      given the option of either withdrawing their Submission,
	      or of accepting an open extension to the duration of their Submission's pre-screening process.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Appointment of Editor-in-charge</strong>
	    <ol>
	      <li>First appointment
		<p>The first Fellow of the Editorial College
		  (or, for <em>Commons</em>- or <em>Proceedings</em>-class Journals, guest Fellow)
		  who accepts an assignment,
		  or who volunteers while perusing the pool, becomes Editor-in-charge of the Submission,
		  under the conditions that:
		  <ul>
		    <li>the Submission's main specialty matches one of the Fellow's stated specialties</li>
		    <li>there is no conflict of interest of any form between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		    <li>there is no personal or hierarchical relationship between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		    <li>the Fellow has not co-authored a paper with any of the Submission's authors in the last 5 years.</li>
		  </ul>
		  <br/>
		  It is the responsibility of the Fellow to ensure that these conditions are met.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Reappointment
		<p>In the case of a Resubmission, the original Submission's Editor-in-charge is
		  automatically appointed as Editor-in-charge for the Resubmission.</p>
	      <li>Replacement of the Editor-in-charge
		<p>Upon explicit request by the Editor-in-charge, or in circumstances in which the editorial processing of a given
		  Submission is suffering from unreasonable delays, the Editorial Administration
		  reserves the right to seek a replacement for Editor-in-charge of that Submission.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Refereeing rounds</strong>
	    <ol>
	      <li>Choice of refereeing cycle
		<p>
		  Upon appointment, the Editor-in-charge can choose one of the following cycles:
		  <ul>
		    <li>default refereeing cycle</li>
		    <li>short refereeing cycle</li>
		    <li>direct Editorial Recommendation</li>
		  </ul>
		</p>
		<p>
		  For first-time submission, the choice is between the default refereeing cycle, or the direct Editorial Recommendation. For resubmission, all three choices are available, the short cycle being meant for rapid re-consultation of referees from previous rounds. Upon choosing either the direct or short refereeing cycles, the online Submission Page is automatically created and opened for contributed Reports and Comments, and the Editor-in-charge is required to immediately open a refereeing round.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Opening
		<p>For the default or short cycles,
		  a refereeing round must be opened. For a default refereeing cycle,
		  at least 3 referees must be invited to provide a Report. For the short cycle (meant for resubmissions), at least one of the previous referees must be reinvited.
		  Referees can accept or decline the invitation; if a referee declines or fails to commit
		  within 5 working days, the Editor-in-charge must seek an alternative referee.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Duration
		<p>The indicated duration of a refereeing round in the default cycle is 4 weeks for normal papers and 8 weeks for Lecture Notes,
		  counted from the moment one of the invited referees first accepts to provide a report. For the short cycle, the duration is 2 weeks.
		  Referees will automatically be sent reminders of impending deadlines.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Access to identities
		<p>Besides the invited Reports, contributed Reports and Comments can also be provided by
		  registered Contributors. Although anonymity can be requested by the Contributor, this implements anonymity on the public interface only: the
		  identity of the authors of all contributed material is accessible to Editorial Administration and to the Editor-in-charge of
		  the Submission. It is forbidden for them to reveal those identities in any
		  way, except to non-conflicted members of the Editorial College or of the Advisory Board if it is deemed
		  necessary.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Admissibility of Reports and Comments
		<p>The Editor-in-charge must ensure that referees he/she invites to report on a given manuscript
		  are in particular not in conflict of interest, personal or hierarchical relationship with any of the authors
		  and more generally fulfil the conditions stated in the
		  <a href="{% url 'journals:journals_terms_and_conditions' %}#referee_obligations">referee obligations</a>.
		  Similarly, the Editor-in-charge must verify that the authors of contributed Reports and Comments
		  also fulfil these conditions (this occurring during vetting of the Report). If in doubt, the Editor-in-charge
		  must disregard the Reports and Comments in question when formulating the Editorial Recommendation.
		  The Editorial Administration monitors the correctness of the implementation of these conditions.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Closing and author reponse
		<p>At the end of the stated duration, submission of Reports on the Submission Page is deactivated.
		  The Editor-in-charge invites the authors to finalize their responses to any submitted Reports
		  and Comments before the Editorial Recommendation is formulated.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Minimal number of Reports
		<p>
		  Two types of Reports are considered: <em>invited</em> and <em>contributed</em>,
		  respectively from Editor-in-charge-invited or from volunteer referees.
		  Moreover, upon vetting, the Editor-in-charge determines whether a Report is
		  <em>substantial</em> (if it reviews the Submission
		  in a thorough and complete manner) or <em>fractional</em> (if it covers only
		  some aspects).
		  The minimal number of Reports required for the Editor-in-charge to make a
		  recommendation depends on the Journal which is submitted to:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>for field-leading titles: at least two substantial Reports,
		    at least one of which is an invited one</li>
		  <li>for <em>Commons</em> and other field-specific titles: at least one
		    substantial Report</li>
		  <li>for <em>Proceedings</em>: at least one Report.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p>
		  If none of the invited referees have responded within the first round,
		  the Editor-in-charge must start a second round and invite three new referees.
		  If no invited or contributed Report has been obtained at the end of the second round,
		  the Editor-in-charge can elect to put forth a motion of rejection due to lack
		  of interest, or to extend the refereeing round.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Editorial Recommendation</strong>
	    <p>An Editorial Recommendation is formulated by the Editor-in-charge at the end of a
	      refereeing round. The recommendation is based on the invited Reports, eventual contributed
	      Reports, eventual Comments together with the Editor-in-charge's own assessment of the Submission.
	      Such a recommendation is not made publicly visible. The recommendation can be for:
	      <ul>
		<li>Publication as Select (reserved for the top 10% of papers submitted to a field-leading title)</li>
		<li>Publication (in the targeted Journal)</li>
		<li>Publication (promotion to field-leading Journal)</li>
		<li>Publication (transfer to other Journal)</li>
		<li>Minor revision</li>
		<li>Major revision</li>
		<li>Rejection.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>A recommendation to Publish as Select, Publish or Reject is immediately forwarded to the
		  Editorial College for decision. It is at this stage not communicated to the authors.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>If the Editorial Recommendation is for a minor or major revision, it is communicated
		  directly to the authors, who must then resubmit. Upon resubmission, the Editor-in-charge
		  can either start a new refereeing round or directly formulate a new editorial recommendation.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li><strong>Editorial College Vote</strong>
	    <p>
	      The decision to publish or reject a paper is formally taken by the relevant
	      Editorial College.
	      After being formulated by the Editor-in-charge, the Editorial Recommendation
	      is made visible to all non-conflicted Fellows.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      A number of Fellows (depending on the recommentation, see below) is selected by Editorial Administration and specifically given voting rights on the Recommendation. This selection is made to ensure sufficient expertise, enforce checks on impartiality and avoid conflicts of interest. Other qualified Fellows can claim voting rights on the Recommendation if they so wish, by contacting Editorial Administration (in the interest of workflow control, not all Fellows are expected to vote on all Recommendations, but rather only on the ones they are given voting rights on).
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      At this point, the Recommendation can be one of these possibilities:
	    </p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>(for submissions to field-leading titles only) Publication as Select</li>
	      <li>Publication</li>
	      <li>Transfer to other Journal for Publication</li>
	      <li>Rejection.</li>
            </ul>
	    <br/>
	    <p>The precise voting protocol depends on the Recommendation:</p>
	    <ol>
	      <li><strong>Publication as Select</strong>
		<p>
		  Submissions to a field-leading title which are deemed to be of superlative
		  quality (top 10% of the manuscripts published in that title) by the
		  Editor-in-charge can be put forward for potential publication
		  as Select. In this case, all Fellows of the Editorial College in the relevant
		  discipline can participate in the decision,
		  except for those in conflict of interest, personal or hierarchical relationship
		  with any of the authors. The Editor-in-charge by definition supports this promotion
		  to Select and does not need to vote;
		  other Fellows are asked to agree, abstain or disagree with the recommendation
		  to publish as Select. Editorial Administration initiates the vote by giving 9 specialist
		  and 6 further same-discipline Fellows voting rights. The Submission is promoted to Select if either:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>specialist Fellows unanimously agree</li>
		  <li>a majority of specialist Fellows agrees, and no Fellow disagrees.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p>
		  If the Submission is not promoted to Select, the rules for normal Publication apply.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If the Submission is promoted to Select, then the main paper is prepared
		  for publication in the field-leading title, and the extended abstract is separately
		  prepared for publication in SciPost Selections.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li><strong>Publication</strong>
		<p>
		  If the editorial recommendation is to publish the paper, Fellows with expertises
		  corresponding to those of the Submission can vote to agree, abstain or disagree with
		  publication. Editorial Administration initiates the vote by giving 9 specialist Fellows voting rights. The Submission is accepted if:
		</p>
		<ul>
		  <li>at least 4 specialist Fellows agree and none disagree</li>
		  <li>a majority of specialist Fellows agrees.</li>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		<p>
		  Upon acceptance, the authors are informed and the paper is immediately
		  forwarded to Production.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If the editorial recommendation was to accept the paper, but the voting
		  conditions for acceptance given above are not met, then the Editor-in-charge
		  must reformulate the recommendation to either:
		  <ul>
		    <li>a request for revision, which is then forwarded to the authors, further
		      consideration of the manuscript then following the rules for resubmission</li>
		    <li>publication in another Journal</li>
		  </ul>
		  <br/>
		  For example, a submission failing to meet the requirements to be published
		  in a field-leading title can be put forward for publication in the field's
		  <em>Commons</em> title.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li><strong>Rejection</strong>
		<p>
		  If the editorial recommendation is to reject the paper, specialist Fellows are asked
		  to agree, abstain, or veto the recommendation. Editorial Administration initiates the vote by giving 9 specialist Fellows voting rights.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If a majority of specialist
		  Fellows agrees to reject, the paper is rejected.
		</p>
		<p>
		  If a majority is not reached and
		  a Fellow disagrees with the recommendation to reject the paper,
		  that Fellow is invited to
		  take over as Editor-in-charge of the Submission and to start a
		  new refereeing round. If none of the disagreeing Fellows accept to take charge,
		  the paper is rejected.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Otherwise, if a majority is not reached but no Fellow has vetoed the
		  rejection recommendation, the paper is rejected.
		</p>
		<p>
		  Upon rejection, the authors are informed, the Submission Page
		  is deactivated and its contents removed from public view, unless the
		  authors explicitly request otherwise.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li><strong>Special provision for <em>Proceedings</em></strong>
		<p>For <em>Proceedings</em>-class Journals, the publication decision process is
		  delegated to the set of guest Fellows associated to the Proceedings Issue concerned.
		  To maintain high quality standards, the field's Editorial College retains rights
		  of regard and veto on any decisions taken by guest Fellows.
		</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>

	      limited to approximately one half-day per month on average.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment by the Foundation
	    <p>If the number of Fellows in a stated specialty is below the required minimum number,
	      or if the number of currently available Fellows in a stated specialty has diminished to a level
	      where processing of Submissions becomes delayed,
	      the Foundation has the right to directly nominate and immediately appoint
	      individuals deemed to fulfill the eligibility criteria.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment by election
	    <p>Foundation board members, members of the Advisory Board as well as current and past
	      Fellows of the Editorial College can nominate candidates for an Editorial Fellowship.
	      Candidates must fulfill the eligiblity criteria.
	      These nominations shall be forwarded to the Editorial College for voting, at the
	      latest at the next Virtual General Meeting.
	      If a candidate secures a positive vote from at least three quarters of the Fellows currently
	      caring for the candidate's stated main expertise, and if no veto is received from
	      Fellows in other subject areas, from the Advisory Board or from the Foundation's Board,
	      then the candidate is deemed elected, and is invited to join by the Foundation.
	      Appointment to the Editorial College starts immediately upon receipt of a positive answer
	      from the candidate.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Duration
	    <p>An appointment as Fellow of the Editorial College is for a duration of 2 years.</p>

	      Fellows and their stated expertises is published on the website.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Renewal
	    <p>An appointment is renewable without limitation. A Fellow coming to the end of
	      an appointment is automatically put up for re-election by the Editorial College, unless
	      the said Fellow has informed the Foundation of his/her desire not to renew, or if the Foundation
	      or the Advisory Board vetoes the renewal.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>End of appointment

    <li>Meetings <a href="javascript:;" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="toggle" data-target="#MeetingsOld">view/hide</a>
      <div id="MeetingsOld" class="py-2" style="display: none;">
	<p>The Editorial College, consisting of internationally-renowned scientists with a broad
	  geographic distribution, does not physically meet. Meetings are instead organized
	  using online facilities.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Virtual General Meetings
	    <p>Once per year, Fellows of the Editorial College are asked to participate in a
	      virtual general meeting. The meeting is organized by the Foundation and takes
	      place over the course of one week during the month of January.</p>
	    <p>For the VGM, a special web page is activated, which is accessible only to
	      Fellows of the Editorial College, members of the Advisory Board and Foundation Board members.
	      This page contains items and points of discussion put forward by the Foundation, Advisory Board and Editorial Fellows,
	      and can be consulted and acted upon by Board members and Fellows at their own leisure during the week of the meeting.
	      The meeting is chaired by the Foundation's chairman.
	      During the week of the meeting, Fellows are able to comment on individual items and
	      bring forth motions for voting.
	      Re-elections, new nominations to the College and suggested amendments to the By-laws must appear
	      among the items at the meeting.</p>
	    <p>At the end of the week, the meeting is closed, and motions are put forward
	      for voting, which is open online for one week after the end of the VGM.</p>
	    <p>Within one week following the end of voting, the Foundation implements the decisions taken
	      and releases the minutes of the VGM to the Advisory Board and Editorial College.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Extraordinary Virtual Meetings
	    <p>At any time, the Foundation can call an Extraordinary Virtual Meeting, to
	      discuss pressing issues with the Editorial College. This meeting must be
	      announced at least one week before its scheduled start.
	      An EVM otherwise follows the same procedures as a VGM.

    <li>Submissions processing <a href="javascript:;" class="btn btn-default" data-toggle="toggle" data-target="#SubmissionsProcessingOld">view/hide</a>
      <div id="SubmissionsProcessingOld" class="py-2" style="display: none;">
	<p>The primary responsibility of the Editorial College is to run the editorial process
	  for all SciPost Journals. The College shall strive for the very highest standards of
	  professionalism achievable in the refereeing process.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Submissions pool
	    <p>
	      Incoming Submissions are added to the pool of manuscripts under consideration for publication.
	      This pool is visible to all members of the Editorial College, as well as to the Advisory Board and Foundation.
	      Each item in the pool represents a single Submission's whole history, including
	      possible earlier (pre-resubmission) versions.</p>
	    <p>
	      Submissions in the pool can be in any of the following stages:
	      <ul>
		<li>Pre-screening</li>
		<li>Editor-in-charge appointed</li>
		<li>Refereeing round open</li>
		<li>Refereeing round closed</li>
		<li>Editorial Recommendation given</li>
		<li>Awaiting resubmission</li>
		<li>Editorial College decision pending</li>
		<li>Rejected</li>
		<li>In production</li>
		<li>Published</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Pre-screening
	    <p>
	      For each Submission added to the pool, five Fellows are sent an assignment request
	      to become Editor-in-charge.
	      The recipients of these requests are selected by matching the submission's specialty
	      specifiers to the stated specialties of the Fellows, priority being given to Fellows
	      marked as currently available.
	      Other Fellows within the Editorial College do not receive an assignment request but
	      can still view a Submission's details and volunteer to become Editor-in-charge
	      through their visibility rights on the Submissions pool.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Each assigned Fellow can explicitly decline the assignment, stating a reason among:
	      too busy, conflict of interest, insufficiently qualified or not interested.
	      Each time a Fellow declines, a new assignment request is sent to a different Fellow.
	      If 5 assignments are declined citing lack of interest, the Submission is returned
	      to the authors and not considered for further processing towards publication.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The Editorial College must make all reasonable efforts to ensure that the pre-screening process
	      be completed within 5 working days starting from the moment of submission.
	      If this proves impossible (for example due to a large influx of submissions and current
	      unavailability of specialist Fellows), the authors are informed of the delay and
	      given the option of either withdrawing their Submission,
	      or of accepting an open extension to the duration of their Submission's pre-screening process.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment of Editor-in-charge
	    <p>The first Fellow of the Editorial College who accepts an assignment,
	      or who volunteers while perusing the pool, becomes Editor-in-charge of the Submission,
	      under the conditions that:
	      <ol>
		<li>the Submission's main specialty matches one of the Fellow's stated specialties</li>
		<li>there is no conflict of interest of any form between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		<li>there is no personal or hierarchical relationship between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		<li>the Fellow has not co-authored a paper with any of the Submission's authors in the last 5 years.</li>
	      </ol>
	      It is the responsibility of the Fellow to ensure that these conditions are met.</p>
	    <p>Upon appointment of the Editor-in-charge, the online Submission Page is automatically
	      created and opened for contributed Reports and Comments, and the Editor-in-charge is required to
	      immediately open a refereeing round.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Refereeing rounds
	    <ol>
	      <li>Opening
		<p>Upon appointment of the Editor-in-charge, or resubmission after a major revision,
		  a refereeing round must be opened.
		  At least 3 referees must be invited to provide a Report.
		  Referees can accept or decline the invitation; if a referee declines or fails to commit
		  within 5 working days, the Editor-in-charge must seek an alternative referee.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Duration
		<p>The indicated duration of a refereeing round is 4 weeks for normal papers and 8 weeks for Lecture Notes,
		  counted from the moment one of the invited referees first accepts to provide a report.
		  Referees will automatically be sent reminders of impending deadlines.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Access to identities
		<p>Besides the invited Reports, contributed Reports and Comments can also be provided by
		  registered Contributors. Although anonymity can be requested by the Contributor upon
		  submission of a contributed Report, this implements anonymity on the public interface only: the
		  identity of the authors of all contributed Reports are accessible to the Editor-in-charge of
		  the Submission. It is forbidden for the Editor-in-charge to reveal those identities in any
		  way, except to members of the Editorial College or of the Advisory Board if it is deemed
		  necessary.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Admissibility of Reports and Comments
		<p>The Editor-in-charge must ensure that referees he/she invites to report on a given manuscript
		  are in particular not in conflict of interest, personal or hierarchical relationship with any of the authors
		  and more generally fulfill the conditions stated in the
		  <a href="{% url 'journals:journals_terms_and_conditions' %}#referee_obligations">referee obligations</a>.
		  Similarly, the Editor-in-charge must verify that the authors of contributed Reports and Comments
		  also fulfill these conditions. If in doubt, the Editor-in-charge
		  must disregard the Reports and Comments in question when formulating the Editorial Recommendation.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Closing and author reponse
		<p>At the end of the stated duration, submission of Reports on the Submission Page is deactivated.
		  The Editor-in-charge invites the authors to finalize their responses to any submitted Reports
		  and Comments before the Editorial Recommendation is formulated.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Minimal number of invited Reports
		<p>For the refereeing round to be considered valid, at least one invited Report must be
		  obtained. If none of the invited referees have responded within the first round,
		  the Editor-in-charge must start a second round and invite three new referees.
		  If no invited or contributed report has been obtained at the end of the second round, the paper is deemed as
		  being rejected due to lack of interest.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Editorial Recommendation
	    <p>An Editorial Recommendation is formulated by the Editor-in-charge at the end of a
	      refereeing round. The recommendation is based on the invited Reports, eventual contributed
	      Reports, eventual Comments together with the Editor-in-charge's own assessment of the Submission.
	      Such a recommendation is not made publicly visible. The recommendation can be for:
	      <ul>
		<li>Publication as Select (reserved for the top 10% of papers published)</li>
		<li>Publication</li>
		<li>Minor revision</li>
		<li>Major revision</li>
		<li>Rejection.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>A recommendation to Publish as Select, Publish or Reject is immediately forwarded to the
		  Editorial College for decision. It is at this stage not communicated to the authors.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>If the Editorial Recommendation is for a minor or major revision, it is communicated
		  directly to the authors, who must then resubmit. Upon resubmission, the Editor-in-charge
		  can either start a new refereeing round or directly formulate a new editorial recommendation.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Editorial College Vote
	    <p>The decision to publish or reject a paper is formally taken by the Editorial College.
	      After being formulated by the Editor-in-charge, the Editorial Recommendation is forwarded to all Fellows.
	      At this point, the recommendation can be one of three possibilities:
	      <ul>
		<li>Publication as Select</li>
		<li>Publication</li>
		<li>Rejection.</li>
              </ul>

	      <ol>
		<li>Publication as Select
		  <p>Submissions which are deemed to be of superlative quality (top 10% of the manuscripts
		    published) by the Editor-in-charge can be put forward for potential publication as Select.
		    In this case, all Fellows of the Editorial College in the relevant discipline can participate in the decision,
		    except for those in conflict of interest, personal or hierarchical relationship with any of the authors.
		    The Editor-in-charge by definition supports this promotion to Select and does not need to vote;
		    other Fellows are asked to agree, abstain or disagree with the recommendation to publish
		    as Select. The Submission is promoted to Select if either:
		    <ul>
		      <li>specialist Fellows unanimously agree</li>
		      <li>a majority of specialist Fellows agrees, and no Fellow disagrees.</li>
		    </ul>
		    If the Submission is not promoted to Select, the rules for normal Publication apply.
		</li>
		<li>Publication
		  <p>If the editorial recommendation is to publish the paper, Fellows with expertises
		    corresponding to those of the Submission can vote to agree, abstain or disagree with
		    publication. The Submission is accepted if:
		    <ol>
		      <li>at least 4 specialist Fellows agree and none disagree</li>
		      <li>a majority of all specialist Fellows agrees.</li>
		    </ol>
		    Upon acceptance, the authors are informed and the paper is immediately forwarded to Production.</p>
		  <p>If the editorial recommendation was to accept the paper, but the voting conditions for acceptance given above are not met, then the recommendation is changed to a request for revision and is forwarded to the authors, and further consideration of the manuscript follows the rules for resubmission.</p>
		</li>
		<li>Rejection
		  <p>If the editorial recommendation is to reject the paper, specialist Fellows are asked
		    to agree, abstain, or veto the recommendation.</p>
		  <p>If a majority of specialist
		    Fellows agrees to reject, the paper is rejected.</p>
		  <p>If a majority is not reached and
		    a Fellow vetoes the recommendation to reject the paper, that Fellow automatically
		    takes over as Editor-in-charge of the Submission and is required to start a new refereeing round.</p>
		  <p>Otherwise, if a majority is not reached but no Fellow has vetoed the rejection recommendation,
		    the paper is rejected.</p>
		  <p>Upon rejection, the authors are informed, the Submission Page
		    is deactivated and its contents removed from public view, unless the authors explicitly request
		    otherwise.
		  </p>
		</li>
	      </ol>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Production
	    <p>Post-acceptance, the paper is handled by the production team, who produce the final version
	      of the manuscript and ensure compliance with publication requirements (including outbound
	      references linking). The final version is assigned a DOI and published online in the appropriate SciPost Journal.</p>
