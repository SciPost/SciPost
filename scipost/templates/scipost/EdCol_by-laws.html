  <h1>SciPost Editorial College By-laws</h1>

  <p>Functioning of the SciPost Editorial College is governed by the following set of by-laws.</p>
  <p>These complement and are subsidiary to the legal statutes of Stichting SciPost (hereafter: the Foundation).</p>
  <ol>
    <hr class="hr6"/>
    <li>Composition of the Editorial College <button id="CompositionButton">(view/hide)</button>
      <div id="Composition">
	<ol>
	  <li>Eligibility
	    <p>Fellows of the Editorial College must be active academics with a tenured position 
	      at a recognized university or research institute. They must possess an extensive 
	      publication record demonstrating world-leading research capabilities in at least one
	      stated specialization covered by SciPost Journals. There is no age limitation. 
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Number of Fellows
	    <p>The size of the Editorial College will be such that each stated specialization
	      will be represented by at least 8 Fellows. There is no maximum. The number of Fellows
	      caring for a stated specialization shall be chosen to ensure an average workload 
	      of 5 submissions to process per calendar year per Fellow.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment by the Foundation
	    <p>If the number of Fellows in a stated specialty is below the required minimum number, 
	      the Foundation has the right to directly nominate and appoint individuals deemed to fulfill 
	      the eligibility conditions.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment by election
	    <p>Foundation board members, members of the Advisory Board as well as current and past 
	      Fellows of the Editorial College can nominate candidates for an Editorial Fellowship.
	      Candidates must fulfill the eligiblity conditions. 
	      These nominations shall be forwarded to the Editorial College for voting. 
	      If a candidate secures a positive vote from at least three quarters of the Fellows currently
	      caring for the candidate's stated main specialization, and if no veto is received from
	      Fellows in other specializations, from the Advisory Board or from the Foundation's Board,
	      then the candidate is deemed elected, and is invited to join by the Foundation.
	      Appointment to the Editorial College starts immediately upon receipt of a positive answer
	      from the candidate.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Duration
	    <p>An appointment as Fellow of the Editorial College is for a duration of 2 years.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Renewal
	    <p>An appointment is renewable without limitation. A Fellow coming to the end of 
	      an appointment is automatically re-invited by the Foundation, unless the Foundation 
	      or the Advisory Board vetoes it.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>End of appointment
	    <p>Appointment as an Editorial Fellow immediately ends upon:
	      <ul>
		<li>the Fellow informing the Foundation of his/her wish to cease his/her Fellowship</li>
		<li>the Fellow ceasing to fulfill the eligibility criteria</li>
		<li>the Foundation terminating the appointment.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
    </li>

    <hr class="hr6"/>
    <li>Meetings <button id="MeetingsButton">(view/hide)</button>
      <div id="Meetings">
	<p>The Editorial College, consisting of internationally-renowned scientists with a broad
	  geographic distribution, does not physically meet. Meetings are instead organized
	  using online facilities.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Virtual General Meetings
	    <p>Once per year, Fellows of the Editorial College are asked to participate in a
	      virtual general meeting. The meeting is organized by the Foundation and takes 
	      place over the course of one week during the month of January.</p>
	    <p>For the VGM, a special web page is activated, which is accessible only to 
	      Fellows of the Editorial College, members of the Advisory Board and Foundation Board members.
	      This page containes items and points of discussion put forward by the Foundation.
	      The meeting is chaired by the Foundation's chairman.
	      During the week, Fellows are able to comment on individual items. 
	      Nominations to the College and suggested amendments to the By-laws must appear 
	      among the items.</p>
	    <p>At the end of the week, the meeting is closed, and motions are put forward
	      for voting, which is open online for one week after the end of the VGM.</p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Extraordinary Virtual Meetings
	    <p>At any time, the Foundation can call an Extraordinary Virtual Meeting, to
	      discuss pressing issues with the Editorial College. This meeting must be
	      announced at least two weeks before its scheduled start. An EVM, like a VGM,
	      consists of one week of online discussions followed by one week of voting on
	      motions.</p>
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </div>
    </li>

    <hr class="hr6"/>
    <li>Submissions processing <button id="SubmissionsProcessingButton">(view/hide)</button>
      <div id="SubmissionsProcessing">
	<p>The primary responsibility of the Editorial College is to run the editorial process
	  for all SciPost Journals. The College shall strive for the very highest standards of
	  professionalism achievable in the refereeing process.</p>
	<ol>
	  <li>Submissions queue
	    <p>
	      Incoming Submissions are added to the queue of manuscripts under consideration for publication.
	      This queue is visible to all members of the Editorial College, as well as to the Advisory Board and Foundation.
	      Each item in the queue represents a single Submission's whole history, including
	      possible earlier (pre-resubmission) versions.</p>
	    <p>
	      Submissions in the queue can have one of the following statuses:
	      <ul>
		<li>Pre-screening</li>
		<li>Editor-in-charge appointed</li>
		<li>Refereeing round open</li>
		<li>Refereeing round closed</li>
		<li>Editorial Recommendation given</li>
		<li>Awaiting resubmission</li>
		<li>Editorial College decision pending</li>
		<li>Rejected</li>
		<li>In production</li>
		<li>Published</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Pre-screening
	    <p>
	      For each queued Submission, five Fellows are sent an assignment request.
	      The recipients of these requests are selected by matching the submission's specialty 
	      specifiers to the stated specialties of the Fellows, priority being given to Fellows 
	      marked as currently available.
	      Other Fellows within the Editorial College do not receive an assignment request but
	      can still view a Submission's details through their visibility rights on the Submissions queue.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      Each assigned Fellow can explicitly decline the assignment, stating a reason among:
	      too busy, conflict of interest, or not interested. 
	      Each time a Fellow declines, a new assignment request is sent to a different Fellow. 
	      If 5 assignments are declined citing lack of interest, the Submission is returned
	      to the authors and not considered for further processing towards publication.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The pre-screening process must be completed within 5 working days starting from the
	      moment of submission.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Appointment of Editor-in-charge
	    <p>The first Fellow of the Editorial College who accepts an assignment received, 
	      or who volunteers while perusing the queue, becomes Editor-in-charge of the Submission, 
	      under the conditions that:
	      <ol>
		<li>the Submission's main specialty matches one of the Fellow's stated specialties</li>
		<li>there is no conflict of interest of any form between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		<li>there is no personal or hierarchical relationship between the Fellow and any of the Submission's authors</li>
		<li>the Fellow has not co-authored a paper with any of the Submission's authors in the last 5 years.</li>
	      </ol>
	      Upon appointment of the Editor-in-charge, the online Submission Page is automatically 
	      created and opened for contributed Reports and Comments, and the Editor-in-charge is required to 
	      immediately open a refereeing round.
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Refereeing rounds
	    <ol>
	      <li>Opening
		<p>Upon appointment of the Editor-in-charge, or resubmission after a major revision, 
		  a refereeing round must be opened.
		  At least 3 referees must be invited to provide a Report.
		  Referees can accept or decline the invitation; if a referee declines or fails to commit
		  within 5 working days, the Editor-in-charge must seek an alternative referee.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Duration
		<p>The duration of a refereeing round is 4 weeks for normal papers, 8 weeks for Lecture Notes.
		</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Access to identities
		<p>Besides the invited Reports, contributed Reports and Comments can also be provided by
		  registered Contributors. Although anonymity can be requested by the Contributor upon
		  submisison of a contributed Report, this implements anonymity on the public interface only: the
		  identity of the authors of all contributed Reports are accessible to the Editor-in-charge of
		  the Submission. It is forbidden for the Editor-in-charge to reveal those identities in any
		  way, except to members of the Editorial College or of the Advisory Board if it is deemed
		  necessary.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>Closing and author reponse
		<p>At the end of the stated duration, submission of Reports on the Submission Page is deactivated.
		  The Editor-in-charge invites the authors to finalize their responses to any submitted Reports
		  and Comments before the Editorial Recommendation is formulated.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Editorial Recommendation
	    <p>An Editorial Recommendation is formulated by the Editor-in-charge at the end of a 
	      refereeing round. Such a recommendation is not made publicly visible. The recommendation can be for:
	      <ul>
		<li>Publication as Select (reserved for the top 10% of papers under evaluation)</li>
		<li>Publication</li>
		<li>Minor revision</li>
		<li>Major revision</li>
		<li>Rejection.</li>
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <ol>
	      <li>
		<p>A recommendation to Publish as Select, Publish or Reject is immediately forwarded to the
		  Editorial College for decision. It is at this stage not communicated to the authors.</p>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<p>If the Editorial Recommendation is for a minor or major revision, it is communicated 
		  directly to the authors, who must then resubmit. Upon resubmission, the Editor-in-charge 
		  can either start a new refereeing round or directly formulate a new editorial recommendation.</p>
	      </li>
	    </ol>
	  </li>
	  <li>Editorial College Vote
	    <p>The decision to publish or reject a paper is formally taken by the Editorial College.
	      After being formulated by the Editor-in-charge, the Editorial Recommendation is forwarded to all Fellows.
	      At this point, the recommendation can be one of three possibilities:
	      <ul>
		<li>Publication as Select</li>
		<li>Publication</li>
		<li>Rejection</li>
              </ul>
	      
	      <ol>
		<li>Publication as Select
		  <p>Submissions which are deemed to be of superlative quality (top 10% of the manuscripts
		    refereed) by the Editor-in-charge can be put forward for potential publication as Select.
		    In this case, all Fellows of the Editorial College can participate in the decision.
		    The Editor-in-charge by definition supports this promotion to Select and does not need to vote; 
		    other Fellows are asked to agree, abstain or disagree with the recommendation to publish
		    as Select. The Submission is promoted to Select if either:
		    <ul>
		      <li>specialist Fellows unanimously agree</li>
		      <li>a majority of specialist Fellows agrees, and no Fellow disagrees.</li>
		    </ul>
		    If the Submission is not promoted to Select, the rules for normal Publication apply.
		</li>
		<li>Publication 
		  <p>If the editorial recommendation is to publish the paper, Fellows with specializations
		    corresponding to those of the Submission can vote to agree, abstain or disagree with
		    publication. The Submission is accepted if:
		    <ol>
		      <li>at least 4 specialist Fellows agree and none disagree</li>
		      <li>a majority of all specialist Fellows agrees.</li>
		    </ol>
		  </p>
		</li>
		<li>Rejection
		  <p>If the editorial recommendation is to reject the paper, specialist Fellows are asked
		    to agree, abstain, or veto the recommendation.</p>
		  <p>If a majority of specialist 
		    Fellows agrees to reject, the paper is rejected. In this case, the Submission Page
		    is deactivated and its contents removed from public view.</p>
		  <p>If a majority is not reached and 
		    a Fellow vetoes the recommendation to reject the paper, that Fellow automatically 
		    takes over as Editor-in-charge of the Submission and is required to start a new refereeing round.</p>
		  <p>Otherwise, if a majority is not reached but no Fellow has vetoed the rejection recommendation, 
		    the paper is deemed as rejected.
		  </p>
		</li>
	      </ol>
	    </p>
	  </li>
	  <li>Production
	    <p>Post-acceptance, the paper is handled by the production team, who produce the final .pdf
	      of the manuscript and ensure compliance with publication requirements (among which 
	      references linking). The final .pdf is assigned a DOI and published online in the appropriate SciPost Journal.</p>

	<p>The present By-laws can be amended by:
	  <ul>
	    <li>the Foundation, with veto right (by majority vote) from the Advisory Board</li>
	    <li>by motion at a VGM, the motion being supported by a three-quarters majority vote of all the Editorial Fellows, with veto right (by majority vote) from the Advisory Board.</li>
