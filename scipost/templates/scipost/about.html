  <h1>About SciPost</h1>
  <p>SciPost is a complete scientific publication portal. It is purely online-based, and offers freely, openly, globally and perpetually accessible science. Being managed by professional scientists, and making use of editor-sollicited and contributed reviews, its Journals aim at the highest achievable standards of refereeing. SciPost Commentaries allow Contributors to seamlessly comment on all existing literature.</p>
  <h3>Guiding principles</h3>
  <p>The guiding principles in the conception, implementation and administration of SciPost are:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>scientific publications should undergo the stringest possible peer refereeing process</li>
    <li>peer refereeing should be accountable</li>
    <li>publicly-funded science should be openly accessible to scientists and the general public, perpetually, worldwide</li>
    <li>peer evaluation should not occur exclusively pre-publication</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The first two principles are implemented using SciPost's maximally stringent <a href="{% url 'scipost:peer_witnessed_refereeing' %}">peer-witnessed refereeing</a> process, and by the use of Contributor Ratings.</p>
  <p>The third principle is reflected in SciPost's not-for-profit status, financially backed by the generous support of national granting agencies, universities, foundations and individuals (see Acknowledgements below).</p>
  <p>The fourth principle is implemented in the form of Commentary Pages associated to publications. These can either be SciPost publications, or papers published elsewhere.</p>
