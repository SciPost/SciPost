Dear {{ contact.get_title_display }} {{ contact.last_name }},

Recently we contacted you about the SciPost Supporting Partners Board. We would like to know if you and your institution are interested in joining the Supporting Partners Board.

It is greatly appreciated if you could take a few minutes to read through this document and let us know whether your institution would consider joining.

It would be a privilege to welcome you as members of our Supporting Partners Board. Support takes the form of a small financial commitment, collectively pooled to enable SciPost to perform all its publication-related activities, maintain its online portal and implement its long-term development plan.

Your support at this time is crucially required to make our initiative sustainable, and to help make it possible for the community to reap all the benefits deriving form its viable implementation.

I will be happy to provide any required further details. If you are interested, you can simply get in touch via this address (partners@scipost.org). I sincerely hope that SciPost will be able to count on your support.

If you not the right person in your organization to contact about this topic, please let us know.

On behalf of the SciPost Foundation,
Prof. dr Jean-SÃ©bastien Caux
