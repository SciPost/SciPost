        We would hereby like to cordially invite you
        to become a Contributor on SciPost
        (this is required in order to deliver reports;
        our records show that you are not yet registered);
        for your convenience, we have prepared a pre-filled
        <a href="https://scipost.org/invitation/{{ invitation.invitation_key }}">registration form</a>
        for you. After activation of your registration, you will be allowed to contribute,
        in particular by providing referee reports.
    </p>
    <p>
        To ensure timely processing of the submission (out of respect for the authors),
        we would appreciate a quick accept/decline
        response from you, ideally within the next 2 days.
    </p>
    <p>If you are <strong>not</strong> able to provide a Report, you can let us know by simply
        <a href="https://scipost.org/submissions/decline_ref_invitation/{{ invitation.invitation_key }}">
        clicking here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are able to provide a Report, you can confirm this after registering
        and logging in (you will automatically be prompted for a confirmation).
    </p>
    <p>We very much hope that we can count on your expertise,</p>
    <p>Many thanks in advance,</p>

        You will perhaps have already heard about SciPost, a publication
        portal established by and for professional scientists.
    </p>
    <p>
        SciPost.org is legally based on a not-for-profit foundation and will
        operate in perpetuity as a non-commercial entity at the exclusive service
        of the academic sector, bringing a cost-slashing alternative to existing
        practices.
    </p>
    <p>
        SciPost offers a collection of two-way open
        access (no subscription fees, no author fees) journals with extremely
        stringent (peer-witnessed) refereeing, overseen by
        our Editorial College (exclusively composed
        of established, professionally practising scientists). The whole process is
        designed to ensure the highest achievable scientific quality while making the
        editorial workflow as light and efficient as possible.</p>
    <p>
        To go straight to the point, on behalf of the SciPost Foundation
        and in view of your professional expertise, I hereby would
        ike to invite you to become an Editorial Fellow and thus join the
        Editorial College of SciPost Physics.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note that only well-known and respected senior academics are
        being contacted for this purpose. Academic reputation and involvement
        in the community are the most important criteria guiding our
        considerations of who should belong to the Editorial College.
    </p>
    <p>
        To help you in considering this, it would be best if you were to take
        the time to look at the website itself, which is anchored at scipost.org.
        Besides looking around the site, you can also personally register
        (to become a Contributor, without necessarily committing to membership
        of the Editorial College, this to be discussed separately) by visiting
        the following <a href="https://scipost.org/invitation/{{ invitation.invitation_key }}">
        single-use link</a>, containing a partly pre-filled form for
        your convenience.</p>
    <p>
        Many details about the initiative
        can then be found at <a href="https://scipost.org/about">SciPost About</a> and at <a href="https://scipost.org/FAQ">SciPost FAQ</a>.
        Functioning of the College will proceed according to the by-laws set
        out in <a href="https://scipost.org/EdCol_by-laws">the by-laws</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the success of this initiative is dependent on the involvement of
        the very people it is meant to serve, we'd be very grateful if you were
        to give due consideration to this proposal. We would expect you to
        commit just 2-4 hours per month to help perform Editorial duties; we will
        constantly adjust the number of Editorial Fellows to ensure this is the case. You
        could try it out for 6 months or a year, and of course you could quit
        any time you wished.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'd be happy to provide you with more information, should you require
        it. In view of our development plans, I would be grateful if you could
        react (by replying to this email) within the next two or three weeks,
        if possible. I'll be looking forward to your reaction, your comments
        and suggestions, be they positive or negative. If you need more time
        to consider, that's also fine; just let me know.
