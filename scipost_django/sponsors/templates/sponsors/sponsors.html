	  <p>SciPost does not charge any subscription fees or article processing charges (APCs): all our operations are performed as a community service, with no user-facing charges;</p>
	  <p>Our initiative's scope is resolutely international: we do not impose any geographical or institutional restrictions on the delivery of our services;</p>
	  <p>SciPost is dedicated to serving the academic community, with no further competing interests.</p>

	<div class="card-body">
	  <p>Our sharp focus on openness through our <a href="/FAQ#pwr">peer-witnessed refereeing</a> procedure equips us with arguably the most stringent editorial quality control system available;</p>
	  <p>Our <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#editorial_college_physics">Editorial College</a> is composed of a broad selection of top academics;</p>
	  <p>Our fully professional publishing services meet or surpass best practices in all respects. Our flagship journal SciPost Physics has been awarded the <a href="https://doaj.org">DOAJ</a> Seal.</p>

	  <p>Our operations are obviously not without cost, but our strictly not-for-profit setup, community-led workflow, streamlined infrastructure and no-frills administration mean that the average per-publication costs are much lower than those of competing services;</p>
	  <p>Our financing model relies on sponsorship from the organizations which benefit from our activities (see our <a href="{% url 'organizations:organizations' %}">organizations page</a>);</p>
	  <p>All sponsorship funds are pooled and exclusively used to run our infrastructure and services.</p>

      <h3>We aim to establish a healthier <a href="{% url 'finances:business_model' %}" target="_blank">business model</a> for scientific publishing</h3>
      <p>We are able to run a fully sustainable infrastructure at an estimated cost of under &euro;400 per publication, much below the current norm for APCs. The more scientists shift their publishing to SciPost, the fewer subscription/article processing charges you will have to pay as an organization. Your sponsorship will help us scale up and make our initiative sustainable.</p>
