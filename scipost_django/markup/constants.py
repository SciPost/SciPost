You can have simple inline equations like this: $E = mc^2$ by enclosing them with

### Displayed maths

For displayed maths, you need to enclose the equations with escaped square brackets

\[
H = \sum_j {\boldsymbol S}_j \cdot {\boldsymbol S}_{j+1}
\]

or with double dollar signs (though it works, this is less good,
since beginning and end markers are not distinguishable):

$$
H = \sum_j S^x_j S^x_{j+1} + S^y_j S^y_{j+1} + \Delta S^z_j S^z_{j+1}

Multiline equations can be obtained by using the ``\\`` carriage return as usual;
to align your equations, use the ``align`` environment. For example:

\[
\begin{align*}
\nabla \cdot {\boldsymbol E} &= \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}, &
\nabla \times {\boldsymbol E} + \frac{\partial \boldsymbol B}{\partial t} &= 0, \\
