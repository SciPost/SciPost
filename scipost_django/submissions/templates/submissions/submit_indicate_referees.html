        <h4>SciPost refereeing system</h4>
        <p>
          SciPost relies on a unique <a href="{% url "submissions:editorial_procedure" %}">editorial procedure</a> whose first evaluation step (the Assignment phase) requires a Fellow of the Editorial College to actively take charge of an incoming Submission. 
          Taking charge is voluntary: therefore <strong>SciPost does NOT guarantee</strong> that all manuscripts in the Assignment phase will eventually be picked up for refereeing. 
          Fellows taking charge of a manuscript do so on the basis of their expertise, and on the scientific quality and topical interest of the manuscript.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can facilitate the Assignment process by suggesting referees that are experts in the field (being careful to avoid competing interests). 
          Furthermore, you can also advise against referees that you believe are not suitable for refereeing your manuscript, provided you have a valid reason for this. 
          Referees suggested by the authors are not automatically selected for (or excluded from) refereeing, but can serve as a guide for the editors who ultimately decide who to invite.
        </p>
