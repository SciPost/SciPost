        <h4>SciPost refereeing system</h4>
        <p>
          SciPost relies on a unique refereeing system, where editors are responsible for the selection of manuscripts at a voluntary basis.
          Therefore, <strong>SciPost does not guarantee that all manuscripts will be picked up for refereeing</strong> by an editor.
          Most often, editors selecting a manuscript do so on the basis of their expertise, the novelty / interest of the manuscript and the availability of referees.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can help potential editors of your manuscript by suggesting referees that are experts in the field and are not in conflict of interest with the authors.
          Furthermore, you can also advise against referees that you believe are not suitable for refereeing your manuscript, provided you have a valid reason for this.
          The referees suggested by the authors are not automatically selected for refereeing, but can serve as a guide for the editors who ultimately decide who to invite for refereeing.
        </p>
