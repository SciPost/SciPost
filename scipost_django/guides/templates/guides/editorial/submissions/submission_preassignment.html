<h1>Submission preassignment</h1>
<p>
  This document describes the workflow starting at the moment of submission, and leading up to the start of the refereeing process by a Fellow of the Editorial College. Editorial Administrators should use these instructions to correctly shepherd submissions through the preassignment phase.
</p>

<h3>Reception phase</h3>

<h4>Plagiarism check</h4>
<p>
  Upon reception of a submission, the first action is to perform the plagiarism check. This is performed using Crossref Similarity Check (hereunder CSC), which makes use of the iThenticate application. EdAdmin should run this plagiarism page using the tools on the Submission's page.
</p>
<p>
  After a few minutes, the plagiarism check document becomes available (under Report). This should be examined thoroughly. A percentage above about 15% is cause for concern.
</p>

<h3>Assignments</h3>

<h3>Compliance with Crossref DOI requirements</h3>
<p>
  If the Submission's references are not properly formatted,
  and/or if these do not include the required DOIs,
  the authors should be asked to do so in their resubmission.
