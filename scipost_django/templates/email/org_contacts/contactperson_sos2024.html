  Dear {% if contactperson %}{{ contactperson.get_title_display }} {{ contactperson.last_name }}{% else %}colleagues{% endif %},
</p>
<p>
  I am contacting you on behalf of SciPost, a scientists-driven not-for-profit initiative whose mission is to provide Genuine Open Access academic publishing services.
</p>
<p>
  Since our beginnings in 2016, {{ contactperson.organization.get_author_profiles|length }} scientists associated to your institution have published {{ contactperson.organization.cf_balance_info.cumulative.nap }} papers with us. You can find all these details at your institution's detail page <a href="https://{{ domain }}{{ contactperson.organization.get_absolute_url }}">{{ domain }}{{ contactperson.organization.get_absolute_url }}</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As explained on our <a href="https://{{ domain }}{% url 'finances:business_model' %}">business model</a> page, SciPost follows a completely different funding model than traditional publishers, and provides a cost-slashing alternative to existing platforms. SciPost charges neither subscription fees, nor article processing charges; its activities are instead collectively financed by a worldwide consortium of Sponsors, formed by institutions like yours which benefit from SciPost’s activities. We do however compile a measure of how these activities impact our reserves; as far as your institution is concerned, this can be found under the Support history tab of your detail page (linked above).
</p>
<p>
  Our continued existence is contingent on us being able to gather sufficient support from the academic institutions which benefit from our activities. We are now on a campaign to improve sustainability of our services and as part of this, we're engaging with institutions which haven't yet supported us.
</p>
<p>
  We are currently facing quite high pressures on our liquidities (see the up-to-date status at https://scipost.org/finances/#current ), which are representing an immediate threat to our continued existence. Separately from this, we have also recently committed to the Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure (see https://scipost.org/posi), which require us to put our long-term sustainability on a firmer level.
</p>
<p>
  We would thus like to ask: in recognition of the value of the services we have delivered to your scientists in the past and can deliver in the future, could you provide support for our operations?
</p>
<p>
  As per our charitable principles, this is not obligatory and your level of contribution is entirely up to you. We however hope that you understand that our sustainability is threatened by lack of incoming resources. Welcoming you as a supporting organization would help alleviate this.
</p>
<p>
  Feel free to get in touch by simply replying to this email. I sincerely hope that SciPost will be able to count on your support to ensure its continued existence.
</p>
<p>
  On behalf of the SciPost Foundation,<br><br>
