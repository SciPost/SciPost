<p>Dear {{ submission.submitted_by.profile.formal_name }},</p>

<p>
  We regret to inform you that we have been unable to find an Editor-in-charge for your recent Submission to {{ submission.submitted_to }},

  <br />
</p>
<p>
  As per our standard procedures, your Submission was forwarded to specialist Fellows of our {{ submission.submitted_to.college }} for consideration. Unfortunately, none of these Fellows made themselves available to take charge and run the refereeing process.
</p>
<p>
  In view of this, we are unable to proceed further with the handling of your manuscript. We hope you can easily find an alternative publishing venue.
</p>
<p>
  Despite this unsuccessful outcome, we thank you very much for your contribution, and hope to be able to be of service to you in the future.
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>The SciPost Team.</p>
