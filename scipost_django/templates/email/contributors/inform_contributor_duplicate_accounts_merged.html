<p>
  Dear {{ contributor_into.profile.full_name }},
</p>
<p>
  We noticed that you had two separate registrations at SciPost, and have consolidated your two accounts into a single active one, namely your account with username <strong><em style="color: green;">{{ contributor_into.user.username }}</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Your alternate account with username <strong><em style="color: red;">{{ contributor_from.user.username }}</em></strong> has been deactivated, but all the data associated to it has been transferred to your active account.
</p>
<p>
  Please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:techsupport@{{ domain }}">SciPost techsupport</a> (or by simply replying to this email) if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks,
  <br><br>
  The SciPost Team
