<p>Dear {{ invitation.referee.formal_name }},</p>

<p>
  On behalf of the handling Editor {{ invitation.submission.editor_in_charge.profile.formal_name }}, we would like to invite you to review a 500-word submission to the Journal of Robustness Reports, a diamond open-access journal dedicated to reanalyses of published findings:
  <br />
  <a href="https://{{ domain }}{{ invitation.submission.get_absolute_url }}">{{ invitation.submission.title }}</a>
  <br />
  by {{ invitation.submission.author_list }}
  <br />
  (see <a href="https://{{ domain }}{{ invitation.submission.get_absolute_url }}">https://{{ domain }}{{ invitation.submission.get_absolute_url }}</a> - first submitted {{ invitation.submission.original_submission_date|date:"d M Y" }}).
</p>

<p>
  The submitted manuscript provides a concise reanalysis of original findings using an alternative analysis methodology (i.e., a mixed model fitted with brms). Specifically, we'd like you to assess (1) whether or not the alternative analysis is plausible; (2) whether the associated conclusions are reasonable; and (3) whether the tone is sufficiently constructive.
</p>
