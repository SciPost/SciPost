<p>Dear {{ assignment.to.profile.formal_name }},</p>

<p>
  Thank you for accepting to become Editor-in-charge of Submission
  <br />
  <a href="https://{{ domain }}{{ assignment.submission.get_absolute_url }}">{{ assignment.submission.title }}</a>,
  <br />
  by {{ assignment.submission.author_list }}.
</p>

<p>
  You can take your editorial actions from the <a href="https://{{ domain }}/{% url "submissions:editorial_page" assignment.submission.preprint.identifier_w_vn_nr %}">editorial page</a> (also accessible from your <a href="https://{{ domain }}/{% url "scipost:personal_page" %}">personal page</a> under the Editorial Actions tab).
</p>

<p>
  In particular, unless you choose to directly formulate a Recommendation, you should now start a refereeing round. We highly recommend you invite at least {{ assignment.submission.submitted_to.minimal_nr_of_reports }} referees. We also remind you that publication in {{ assignment.submission.submitted_to.name }} requires reports from at least {{ assignment.submission.cycle.minimum_number_of_referees }} individual referees; you might want to make sure you are aware of the detailed procedure described in the <a href="https://{{ domain }}/EdCol_by-laws">Editorial College by-laws</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Many thanks in advance for your collaboration,
  <br />
  The SciPost Team
