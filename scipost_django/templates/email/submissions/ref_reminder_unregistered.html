<p>Dear {{ invitation.referee.formal_name }},</p>

<p>
  On behalf of the Editor-in-charge {{ invitation.submission.editor_in_charge.profile.formal_name }}, we would like to cordially remind you of our recent request to referee
  <br />
  <strong>{{ invitation.submission.title }}</strong>
  <br />
  by {{ invitation.submission.author_list }}.
</p>

<p>
  We would also like to renew our invitation to become a Contributor on SciPost (since our records show that you are not yet registered).
  Your partially pre-filled <a href="https://{{ domain }}/{% url "scipost:invitation" invitation.invitation_key %}">registration form</a> is still available and, upon filling it, your registration will be activated, giving you full access to the portals facilities (in particular allowing you to provide referee reports).
</p>

<p>
  To ensure timely processing of the submission (out of respect for the authors), we would appreciate a quick accept/decline response from you, ideally within the next 2 days.
</p>
<p>
  If you are <strong>not able</strong> to provide a Report,
  you can quickly let us know by clicking <a href="https://{{ domain }}/{% url 'submissions:decline_ref_invitation' invitation.invitation_key %}">decline referee invitation</a>.
</p>
<p>
  If you are able to provide a Report, you can confirm this after registering
  and logging in (you will automatically be prompted for a confirmation).
  Your report can thereafter be submitted by simply clicking on
  the "Contribute a Report" link at the <a href="https://{{ domain }}/{% url "submissions:submission" invitation.submission.preprint.identifier_w_vn_nr %}">Submission page</a>

  {% if invitation.submission.reporting_deadline %}
    before the reporting deadline (currently set at {{ invitation.submission.reporting_deadline|date:"%Y-%m-%d" }})
  {% endif %}

  ; your report will be automatically recognized as an invited report.
</p>

<p>
  You might want to make sure you are familiar with our  <a href="https://{{ domain }}/journals/journals_terms_and_conditions">refereeing code of conduct</a> and with the <a href="https://{{ domain }}/submissions/editorial_procedure">editorial procedure</a>.
</p>

<p>
  We very much hope we can count on your expertise,
  <br />
  and many thanks in advance,
  <br />
  The SciPost Team
