	    <p>
	      Today's Open Access publishing landscape is very polluted and unhealthy:
	      <ul>
		<li>APCs (Article Processing Charges) dominate</li>
		<li>predatory profit-making thrives</li>
		<li>in financial dealings, academic institutions are manifestly
		  being outplayed by private corporations.</li>.
	      </ul>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The consequences include
	      large-scale damage to library budgets, depleted research budgets,
	      and curtailed careers of researchers.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      We would like to re-empower the academic side in this battle for Open Access,
	      by offering an alternative designed by and optimized purely for academic interests.
	    </p>
	    <p>Our business model can be summarized by the following:</p>
	    <p class="m-2">
	      <em>
		We don't charge authors, we don't charge readers,
		we don't send bills to anybody for our services,
		and we certainly don't make any profit;
		we are an academic community service surviving
		on support from Organizations which benefit from
		our activities.
	      </em>
	    </p>
	    <p>Said otherwise, our system is academia's <strong>antidote to APCs</strong>.</p>

	      more detailed explanations below.

		<strong>Publishing and interlinking</strong><br>

	      </li>
	      <li class="m-2">
		<strong>Determining PubFracs</strong><br>
		Upon publication, we compute our PubFracs (a fraction of a unit representing an Organization's "weight" for a given Publication; see the <a href="#pubfracs">PubFracs system description</a> below).
	      </li>

		<strong>Sustaining</strong><br>
		We liaise with Organizations benefitting from our activities, who can inspect all the data and independently determine to which level they choose to support our activities. Generosity is appreciated, bearing in mind the proportion of non-supporting bystanders. We scale up, maintain or wind down our operations depending on how much support we can gather.

	<h2 class="highlight" id="pubfracs">The PubFracs system&emsp;<small><em>a perfect antidote to APCs</em></small></h2>
	<div class="col-lg-6">
	  <p>
	    One of the many failures of APCs (Article Processing Charges) is to
	    not offer a sufficiently fine-grained resolution of each paper's
	    relations to particular Organizations. A paper is
	    usually associated to many Organizations (multiple authors with their
	    individual affiliations; multiple granting agencies etc). APCs are great
	    if you are the business sending the invoice. APCs are a nightmare for academic
	    Organizations caring about equitable cost distribution.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In order to resolve things more finely, and in the belief that
	    <strong><em>equitable is computable</em></strong>, we built our systems
	    based on the idea of <strong>PubFracs</strong>, in which
	    each paper has one unit to be distributed among
	    the Organizations associated to that paper.
	  </p>
	</div>
	<div class="col-lg-6">
	  <p>
	    The PubFrac weight is given by the following simple algorithm: first, the unit
	    is split equally among each of the authors. Then, for each author,
	    their share is split equally among their affiliations. The results are then
	    binned per Organization. By construction, any given paper's PubFracs sum up to $1$.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This information is filled by our editorial administration
	    at the moment of publication.
	    These PubFracs are then automatically compiled and linked to the relevant
	    Organizations. This data is displayed on our Organization detail pages,
	    where further relevant information can also be found
	    (<em>e.g.</em> associated publications, authors,
	    support history).

	  <h3 class="highlight">The APEX page</h3>
	  <p>You will find a detailed listing of our Average Publication Expenditures at our <a href="{% url 'finances:apex' %}">APEX page</a>.</p>
	  <p>This displays a year-by-year, Journal-by-Journal overview of the expenditures we have ascribed to our publishing activities.</p>
	  <p>These numbers are computed according to the following algorithm:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>Each Journal is given a relative weight, to represent the typical amount of resources it takes on our side in order to guide it through refereeing, decision, proofing and publication. Our flaship Journals are given weight 1. Heavier units like Lecture Notes are given 1.5, whereas simpler units like Proceedings are given 0.5.</li>
	    <li>Our financial statements are compiled, giving the total outgoings in a given year.</li>
	    <li>The total outgoings are divided by the sum of (weight for Journal) times (number of papers in that Journal in a given year), giving the APEX for weight-1 Journals. The APEX for other Journals are then obtained by scaling this according to the Journal's weight.</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    The APEX of our Journals fluctuates from year to year, since it depends on our levels of activity (variations in submission and acceptance rates) and our operations (team size, etc.). As a rule of thumb, our APEX is about a factor of 5-7 lower than typical APCs from corporate publishers.</p>

	<div class="col-lg-6">
	  <h3 class="highlight">Why?</h3>
	  <p>
	    It is very important to understand that although we compile data on which Organizations
	    benefit from our activities, <strong>we do not bill these Organizations
	    for the services we provide</strong>. We are a charity whose mission is to serve
	    the global academic community, and our editorial services are neither for sale
	    nor delivered against payment.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This opens up some frequently-asked questions:
	    <ul>
	      <li>why would any Organization donate anything?</li>
	      <li>isn't this simply letting "free-riding" Organizations get substantial value
		on the back of those that <em>-do-</em> contribute?</li>
	    </ul>
	    The reason why Organizations should support us is quite simple:
	    our existence and continued operations saves them money.
	    In fact, it saves them <strong>a lot</strong> of costs
	    which would have otherwise been incurred had their authors published elsewhere.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Our operations would be immediately sustainable if Organizations benefitting from our activities generally supported us at a level commensurate with their PubFrac share.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    The inevitable reality is that some Organizations will remain bystanders, while others do support us more than others. In practice, sustainability thus means equilibrium between
	  </p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>the positive impact of the generosity of Organizations supporting us above their PubFrac share</li>
	    <li>the negative impact on our reserves from Organizations which act as mere bystanders</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p>
	    In fact, a large number of Organizations are associated to our Publications, but have not yet supported us. We call the "unsupported" part of our PubFractions the <em>bystander fraction</em>.
	  </p>
	</div>

	<div class="col-lg-6">
	  <h3 class="highlight">Levels of support</h3>
	  <p>
	    Organizations fall somewhere in the spectrum between those that generously support our activities and fuel our growth, all the way to those that remain bystanders. In fact, we like to categorize them as follows:
	  </p>
	  <table class="table w-auto">
	    <thead>
	      <tr>
		<th>Category</th>
		<th>Support<br>(vs PubFrac share)</th>
		<th>Impact on<br>our reserves</th>
	      </tr>
	    </thead>
	    <tbody>
	      <tr>
		<th class="bg-success bg-opacity-50">{% include 'bi/trophy-fill.html' %}&nbsp;Champion</th>
		<td>4x or more</td>
		<td>strongly positive</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<th class="bg-success bg-opacity-25">{% include 'bi/battery-charging.html' %}&nbsp;Promoter</th>
		<td>Twice or more</td>
		<td>positive</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<th class="bg-success bg-opacity-10">{% include 'bi/battery-full.html' %}&nbsp;Supporter</th>
		<td>On par</td>
		<td>neutral</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<th class="bg-warning bg-opacity-10">{% include 'bi/battery-half.html' %}&nbsp;Sympathizer</th>
		<td>Below</td>
		<td>negative</td>
	      </tr>
	      <tr>
		<th class="bg-danger bg-opacity-25">{% include 'bi/battery.html' %}&nbsp;Bystander</th>
		<td>None</td>
		<td>strongly negative</td>
	      </tr>
	    </tbody>
	  </table>
	  <p>
	    If we could have all Organizations which benefit from our activities land in the Supporter category, we'd be robustly sustainable. Any Pormoter or Champions would then propel our growth. In the meantime, they allow us to survive.

	  We also welcome <strong>in-kind</strong> support from Organizations, in any
	  useful form including (but in no way limited to):
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>sponsorship coordination</strong><br>
	      Is someone (perhaps a library employee or Open Access officer?)
	      willing to help us run our sponsorship scheme, by for example
	      acting as national/regional contact person or coordinator?
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>development assistance</strong><br>
	      Does your Organization have an ICT service with professional-level
	      web programmers? Is any one of them open to the idea of contributing
	      to our project, even on an occasional basis?
	      We can then give them access to our repository at
	      <a href="https://git.scipost.org/">git.scipost.org</a> where we keep
	      all codebases for our online facilities.
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>editorial coordination</strong><br>
	      Does your Organization already have editorial-level staff
	      with broad knowledge of best practices regarding plagiarism,
	      reviewing, archiving, metadata maintenance etc? Within our
	      infrastructure, it is easy for such qualified personnel to contribute to
	      the running of our workflows.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  In-kind support is particularly interesting for us for the following reasons:
	  <ul>
	    <li>it helps Organizations which benefit from our activities to
	      maintain a close relationship with us, to be well aware of our current
	      activities and development plans, and to help us set priorities for the
	      future</li>
	    <li>it provides a channel for significantly useful but non-financial support;
	      this can be particularly interesting for institutions which are facing
	    financial pressures but nonetheless have qualified personnel willing to help</li>
	    <li>it helps making clear that our unitiative belongs to the academic
	      community</li>
	    <li>in view of the fact that our initiative is resolutely international,
	      it helps us to remain aware of and cater for
	      national/regional/local preferences and ways of working.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>Is your Organization interesting in helping us with such in-kind support? Please
	  <a href="mailto:admin@{{ request.get_host }}">contact our administration</a> to discuss
	  concrete possibilities.</p>

      <h2 class="highlight" id="why">Why do we push for this business model?</h2>

      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  We view our model as the <strong><em>cheapest, fairest, simplest</em></strong>
	  model which an academic publishing infrastructure can adopt.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A subscriptions-based model is out of the question because it is
	  incompatible with our
	  core <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#guiding_principles">guiding principles</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also against the author pays model, often
	  implemented through Article Processing Charges (APCs). Why?
	  Besides being arguably quite insulting to scientists,
	  <ul>
	    <li>APCs entangle editorial and financial issues, thereby leading
	      to various degrees of <a href="https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2017/09/18/noble-metals-noble-cause/">"lead pollution"</a>
	      in publishers' operations</li>
	    <li>researchers worldwide cannot uniformly afford publication charges</li>
	    <li>for a multi-author paper, who should pay? Most publishers make it
	      administratively difficult to share costs among researchers</li>
	    <li>the handling of APCs for each individual publication is a substantial
	      time- and resources-wasting accounting exercise.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Our consortial funding model with PubFracs-based recognition
	  solves all these problems in one go. Our pooling of
	  resources and maximally simple accounting drastically simplifies administration
	  for everybody involved. Our transparency means that recognition is given where
	  it is due.
	</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="highlight">Closing words</h3>
      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  As far as our operations are concerned, we run them in the most efficient way possible,
	  with complete transparency, for the benefit not only of scientists worldwide,
	  but also of their supporting Organizations (and anybody else interested in science).
	</p>
	<p>
	  On the question of free-riding, there will of course always
	  be Organizations which are better than others at taking responsibility for themselves,
	  and for the broader community.
	  Though we do not ban free-riding, it does make our model more challenging to
	  sustain. However, since our integrated costs are dramatically lower
	  than those of other publishers,
	  our infrastructure remains cheaper for our sponsors
	  to fund <strong>even if</strong> some level of
	  free-riding is present. And besides, since we make all data public, who
	  deserves credit for supporting us will be
	  clear and transparent for everybody to see.
	</p>
	<p>
	  As far as our sustainability is concerned,
	  we put our trust in the hands of the
	  <a href="{% url 'organizations:organizations' %}">Organizations which
	    benefit from our activities</a>.
