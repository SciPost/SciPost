      <h1 class="highlight">SciPost's Business Model</h1>
      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  SciPost strives to reform the business of academic publishing
	  by providing a top-quality infrastructure covering all aspects
	  of the publishing process while:
	  <ul>
	    <li>being entirely not-for-profit</li>
	    <li>not charging any subscription fees to its readers</li>
	    <li>not charging any publication fees/APCs (article processing charges)
	      to its authors.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  The real drivers of the publishing business are the academics who write,
	  review and edit manuscripts.
	  We view publishing merely as a service making the workflow possible,
	  and empowering scientists to perform these duties in the most efficient
	  way possible.
	</p>
	<p>SciPost's mission is to provide such a service, make it entirely not-for-profit,
	  put its control in the hands of the academic community, and keep it
	  completely free of non-academic competing interests.
	</p>
	<p>
	  If this seems impossibly idealistic to you, <strong>please read on!</strong>
	  We hope that you will find our no-nonsense approach refreshing and convincing.

	    <p>Our business model can be summarized in one phrase:</p>
	    <p class="m-2">
	      <em>
		We don't charge authors, we don't charge readers,
		we don't send bills to anybody for our services,
		and we certainly don't make any profit;
		we are an academic community service surviving
		on donations coming primarily from Organizations which benefit from
		our activities.
	      </em>
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The bullet points here give you the outline; you'll find

	  <div class="col-lg-8">
	    <ul>
	      <li>
		<strong>Linking Publications and Organizations</strong><br>
		As part of our production workflow,
		Organizations (author affiliations, funding agencies, ...)
		listed in our database are linked to each publication.
		This data is publicly displayed on our
		<a href="{% url 'organizations:organizations' %}" target="_blank">Organizations pages</a> in the form of each Organization's NAP (Number of Associated Publications).
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<strong>Determining PubFractions</strong><br>
		After publication, PubFractions are specified
		(a publication's set of PubFractions answers the question "what was each supporting Organization's share of the support for the research leading to this publication?";
		see the <a href="#pubFractions">PubFractions system description</a> below).
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<strong>Determination of operational costs</strong><br>
		On a yearly basis, SciPost determines and makes publicly known:
		<ul>
		  <li>its total expenditures (with a detailed breakdown, see our yearly reports
		    on the <a href="{% url 'finances:finances' %}">finances page</a>)</li>
		  <li>an average cost per publication (estimate for 2019: &euro;400 per paper)</li>
		  <li>the free-riding fraction (proportion of our activities which are
		    benefitting Organizations which for one reason or another are
		    <em>not yet</em> sponsoring SciPost's activities)</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>
		<strong>Sponsorship</strong><br>
		Organizations can inspect all the data (in particular their NAPs and summed-up
		PubFractions, together with the free-riding fraction)
		and hereby determine to which level
		they choose to support SciPost (through a sponsorship agreement).
		Sponsors can fall into different
		<a href="#sponsorshipLevels">recognition levels</a>
		depending on their level of support.

	      The first thing to mention is that we make all our financial data
	      openly available. This includes all revenues and expenditures for
	      all our activities. By going to our <a href="{% url 'finances:finances' %}">Finances page</a> you will find further links to our list of sponsors, the explicit list of

	      We strongly believe that such open accounting is
	      necessary for establishing trust and facilitating verifiability.

	  At SciPost, we curate a database of Organizations which benefit from our
	  publishing activities (think for example of
	  academic institutions which are mentioned in author affiliations
	  and funding agencies listed in funding acknowledgements).
	</p>
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="col-lg-6">
	    <p class="m-2">
	      The data we collect is presented on our

	  <div class="col-lg-6">
	    <p class="m-2">
	      Each Organization also has a detail page, where further information

	      support history).

	    <img style="width: 90%;" class="m-2" src="{% static 'scipost/images/Organization_detail_FWF.png' %}">

      <h3 class="highlight" id="pubFractions">The PubFractions System</h3>
      <div class="m-2">
	<div class="row">
	  <div class="col-lg-6">
	    <p>
	      The NAPs do not offer a very fine-grained resolution of each paper's
	      level of support obtained from particular Organizations. A paper is
	      typically associated to many Organizations (multiple authors with their
	      individual affiliations; multiple granting agencies etc), so NAPs for
	      a given paper can sum up to an abritrarily high value.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      In order to resolve things more finely, we run an internal system
	      based on the idea of <strong>PubFractions</strong>, in which
	      each paper has one unit of support recognition to be distributed among
	      the Organizations having supported the research detailed in that paper.
	      This is not meant to be <em>extremely</em> accurate, but should still
	      somehow honestly reflect the support circumstances.
	    </p>
	    <p>
	      The weight is given by the following simple algorithm: first, the unit
	      is split equally among each of the authors. Then, for each author,
	      their share is split equally among their affiliations.
	      Any given paper's pubfractions sum up to $1$.
	      This information is filled by our editorial administration
	      at the moment of publication.
	      These pubfractions are then automatically compiled and linked to the relevant
	      Organizations. This data is displayed on our Organization detail pages.
	    </p>
	  </div>
	  <div class="col-lg-6">
	    <img style="width: 90%;" class="m-2" src="{% static 'scipost/images/PubFractionsExample.png' %}">

      </div>

      <h3 class="highlight" id="sponsorshipLevels">Sponsorship Levels</h3>
      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  It is very important to understand that although we compile data on which Organizations
	  benefit from our activities, <strong>we do not bill these Organizations
	  for the services we provide</strong>. Our philosophy is to pool all the support we
	  receive, and use these resources to provide services for the community at large.
	</p>
	<p>
	  This opens up some frequently-asked questions:
	  <ul>
	    <li>why would any Organization donate anything?</li>
	    <li>isn't this simply letting "free-riding" Organizations get substantial value
	      on the back of those that <em>do</em> contribute?</li>
	  </ul>
	  The reason why we trust that Organizations will support us is quite simple:
	  each paper we publish which is linked to them, represents a direct economy of publishing
	  costs which would have otherwise been incurred had the authors published elsewhere.
	  Libraries can thus independently establish what the approximate impact of our
	  activities is on their own budget. We trust that simple algebra will then
	  prove our case.
	</p>
	<p>
	  On the question of <strong>free-riding</strong>, there will of course always
	  be Organizations which are better than others at taking responsibility for themselves,
	  and for the broader community.
	  Though we do not ban free-riding, it does make our model more challenging to
	  sustain. However, since our integrated costs are dramatically lower
	  than those of other publishers,
	  our infrastructure remains cheaper for our sponsors
	  to fund <strong>even if</strong> some level of
	  free-riding is present. And besides, since we make all data public, who
	  deserves credit for supporting us will be
	  clear and transparent for everybody to see.

      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  Sponsorships allow us to cover our central personnel and operational costs,
	  and are absolutely crucial to our sustainability.
	  They are however not the only way Organizations can concretely help us in our mission.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We also welcome <strong>in-kind</strong> support from Organizations, in any
	  useful form including (but in no way limited to):
	  <ul>
	    <li><strong>sponsorship coordination</strong><br>
	      Is someone (perhaps a library employee or Open Access officer?)
	      willing to help us run our sponsorship scheme, by for example
	      acting as national/regional contact person or coordinator?
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>development assistance</strong><br>
	      Does your Organization have an ICT service with professional-level
	      web programmers? Is any one of them open to the idea of contributing
	      to our project, even on an occasional basis?
	      We can then give them access to our repository at
	      <a href="https://git.scipost.org/">git.scipost.org</a> where we keep
	      all codebases for our online facilities.
	    </li>
	    <li><strong>editorial coordination</strong><br>
	      Does your Organization already have editorial-level staff
	      with broad knowledge of best practices regarding plagiarism,
	      reviewing, archiving, metadata maintenance etc? Within our
	      infrastructure, it is easy for such qualified personnel to contribute to
	      the running of our workflows.
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  In-kind support is particularly interesting for us for the following reasons:
	  <ul>
	    <li>it helps Organizations which benefit from our activities to
	      maintain a close relationship with us, to be well aware of our current
	      activities and development plans, and to help us set priorities for the
	      future</li>
	    <li>it provides a channel for significantly useful but non-financial support;
	      this can be particularly interesting for institutions which are facing
	    financial pressures but nonetheless have qualified personnel willing to help</li>
	    <li>it helps making clear that our unitiative belongs to the academic
	      community</li>
	    <li>in view of the fact that our initiative is resolutely international,
	      it helps us to remain aware of and cater for
	      national/regional/local preferences and ways of working.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>Is your Organization interesting in helping us with such in-kind support? Please
	  <a href="mailto:admin@{{ request.get_host }}">contact our administration</a> to discuss
	  concrete possibilities.</p>
      </div>

      <h2 class="highlight" id="why">Why do we push for this business model?</h2>

      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  We view our model as the <strong><em>cheapest, fairest, simplest</em></strong>
	  model which an academic publishing infrastructure can adopt.
	</p>
	<p>
	  A subscriptions-based model is out of the question because it is
	  incompatible with our
	  core <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#guiding_principles">guiding principles</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
	  We are also against the author pays model, often
	  implemented through Article Processing Charges (APCs). Why?
	  Besides being arguably quite insulting to scientists,
	  <ul>
	    <li>APCs entangle editorial and financial issues, thereby leading
	      to various degrees of <a href="https://jscaux.org/blog/post/2017/09/18/noble-metals-noble-cause/">"lead pollution"</a>
	      in publishers' operations</li>
	    <li>researchers worldwide cannot uniformly afford publication charges</li>
	    <li>for a multi-author paper, who should pay? Most publishers make it
	      administratively difficult to share costs among researchers</li>
	    <li>the handling of APCs for each individual publication is a substantial
	      time- and resources-wasting accounting exercise.</li>
	  </ul>
	</p>
	<p>
	  Our consortial funding model with pubfractions-based recognition
	  solves all these problems in one go. Our pooling of
	  resources and maximally simple accounting drastically simplifies administration
	  for everybody involved. Our transparency means that recognition is given where
	  it is due.
	</p>
      </div>

      <h3 class="highlight">Closing words</h3>
      <div class="m-2">
	<p>
	  As far as our operations are concerned, we run them in the most efficient way possible,
	  with complete transparency, for the benefit not only of scientists worldwide,
	  but also of their supporting organizations (and anybody else interested in science).
	</p>
	<p>
	  As far as our sustainability is concerned,
	  we put our trust in the hands of the
	  <a href="{% url 'organizations:organizations' %}">Organizations which
