	<th>PubFrac</th>
	<th></th>
	<td>A fraction of a unit representing an Organization's "weight" for a given Publication.<br>The weight is given by the following simple algorithm:
	  <ul>
	    <li>First, the unit is split equally among each of the authors.</li>
	    <li>Then, for each author, their part is split equally among their affiliations.</li>
	    <li>The author parts are then binned per Organization.</li>
	  </ul>
	  By construction, any individual paper's PubFracs sum up to 1.

	    Compensations are computed internally according to the following algorithm:

	      <li>Looping over all Subsidies with nonzero coverage in a given year, their coverage is first used (up to Subsidy depletion) to compensate any PubFrac with direct affiliation to the Subsidy-giver in the given year. These are the <em>self-compensations</em>.</li>
	      <li>The loop is run again, with any non-depleted Subsidy being used to compensated any PubFrac with affiliation to any child Organization of the Subsidy-giver. These are the <em>ally compensations</em>.</li>
