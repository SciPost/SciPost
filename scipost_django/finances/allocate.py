"""
Allocate subsidy amount to compensations of PubFrac or coverage of expenditures.

Algorithm choices:
* [any_aff] Any PubFrac with affiliation to org
* [any_ctry] Any PubFrac with an affiliation in given list of countries
* [any_orgs] Any PubFrac with an affiliation in given list of orgs
  (helps handling interrelated orgs)
* [any_specs] Any PubFrac of publication in given list of specialties
* [all_fund] All PubFracs of publication acknowledging org in Funders
* [all ctry] All PubFracs of publications having at least one affiliation
  in given list of countries
* [all_spec] All PubFracs of publication in given list of specialties
* [all_aff] All PubFracs of publication with at least one author with affiliation to org

Our highest priority is for individual organizations to take responsibility
for their publishing, so the preferred algorithm is aff_org.

The algorithms are implemented in the following order,
(decreasing level of specificity):
* [any_aff]
* [any_ctry]
* [all_fund]
* [all_ctry]
* [all_spec]
* [all_aff]
