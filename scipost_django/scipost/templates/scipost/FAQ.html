  <h3>What is SciPost?</h3>
  <p>SciPost is a complete online publication portal managed by and for scientists.</p>
  <p>
    Preprint handling and circulation occurs through the well-established arXiv;
    the rest of the publication process, from peer refereeing through publication
    all the way to post-publication commenting, is offered by SciPost.
  </p>
  <p>
    Thus, simply stated: share your preprint on <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.arxiv.org">arXiv</a>, publish it in <a href="https://{{ request.get_host }}{% url 'scipost:index' %}">SciPost</a>.

      <div id="journals_refereeing" class="collapse" role="journals_refereeing">
        <p>This is a short summary; for a more detailed description, see our <a href="{% url 'submissions:editorial_procedure' %}">editorial procedure</a>.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Reports are gathered from editorially-invited referees, but can also be volunteered by registered SciPost Contributors during refereeing rounds.</li>
          <li>Reports are posted online (after rapid editorial vetting) on the Submission's Page, and can be replied to (privilege of Authors only) or commented on by all Contributors.</li>
          <li>Anonymity can be preserved at all meaningful stages if desired (as a referee, you can choose to remain anonymous on a particular Report, but named on another).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Contributors thus have additional incentives to actively participate and provide not only high-quality Submissions,
          but also Reports and Comments of the highest achievable professional caliber.
          Quality is moreover promoted by Editorial vetting of all Reports, Replies and Comments before public posting.</p>

          <li>The legal entity behind SciPost is <a href="{% url 'scipost:foundation' %}">Stichting SciPost</a>, a not-for-profit Foundation established in Amsterdam.

        <p>The publishing landscape is evolving rapidly, and it is not clear that the best interests of science and scientists are being represented.
