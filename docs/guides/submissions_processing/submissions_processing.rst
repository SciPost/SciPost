Submission processing
=====================

This document describes the workflow starting at the moment of submission, and leading up to the final decision by the Editorial College. Editorial Administrators should use these instructions to correctly shepherd submissions through the whole refereeing process.


Reception phase
---------------

Plagiarism check
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Upon reception of a submission, the first action is to perform the plagiarism check. This is performed using Crossref Similarity Check (hereunder CSC), which makes use of the iThenticate application. EdAdmin should navigate to the `crosscheck page <https://crosscheck.ithenticate.com/en_us/login>`_ and login using the credentials (ask SciPost Admin if you don't have any).

The .pdf of the submission should be obtained from arXiv, renamed ``####_#####v#_[lastname].pdf``, and saved in the shared folder ``SURFDRIVE/SCIPOST_SUBMISSIONS/[journal_name]/YYYY_MM``. This file should then be uploaded to CSC, in a folder ``[Journal name]_submissions/YYYY-MM`` (this folder should be created if this is that month's first submission; if creating the folder, select the option ``Exclude bibliography``). To upload, click on ``Submit a document``. You will be prompted for the (first) author first and last names, together with the document title (namely: the title of the paper). Clicking ``upload`` starts the plagiarism check (status becomes: processing).

After a few minutes, the plagiarism check document becomes available (under Report). This should be examined thoroughly, downloaded and saved to the SURFDRIVE folder above. A percentage above about 15% is cause for concern.

During refereeing
-----------------


Compliance with Crossref DOI requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the Submission's references are not properly formatted,
and/or if these do not include the required DOIs,
the authors should be asked to do so in their eventual
resubmission.
