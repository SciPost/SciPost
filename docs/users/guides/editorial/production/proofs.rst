.. Howto for proofs

Proofs
======

This guide is meant for **Production supervisors**. It describes the proofs cycle between production team and manuscript authors.


Proofs version production
-------------------------

   * Once the paper has been properly formatted, the ``.tex`` and ``.pdf`` files
     should be copied into new files carrying the ``_proofs_v[nr]`` suffix,
     for example ``SciPost_Phys_1699_9999v9_Bee_proofs_v1.tex``.

   * The ``.pdf`` proofs should be emailed to the authors for verification.
     Authors should return either an annotated pdf or a list of corrections
     by plain text email.

   * Any modifications should be implemented directly in the main ``.tex`` file.

   * If any further check by the authors are required, start this proofs
     todo-list again, increasing the proofs version number.

   * Once the authors have approved the proofs, the paper can be put forward
     to online publication.
