Welcome to SciPost's infrastructure documentation.

The SciPost project aims to transform academic publishing through the creation,
operation and maintenance of a full-fledged, academically-owned infrastructure.
More details about our initiative can be found
at `scipost.org/about <https://scipost.org/about>`_.

This document is meant for geeks, techies and the plain curious.
You will find here a description of the assets and facilities we are building
to turn our vision into reality, most importantly:

- :doc:`codebase documentation <codebase/index>`
  for the software layer at the heart of our
  website `scipost.org <https://scipost.org>`_

- :doc:`deployment information <deployment/index>`
  describing how everything is practically set up

- :doc:`maintenance protocols <maintenance/index>`
  describing the workflows to keep everything in top shape.

You will also find some extra basic information about
the :doc:`SciPost Foundation <foundation/index>`
and :doc:`the infrastructure team <team>`.
