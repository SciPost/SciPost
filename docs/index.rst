Welcome to SciPost's infrastructure documentation.

The `SciPost <https://scipost.org>`_ project aims to transform academic publishing
through the creation,
operation and maintenance of a full-fledged, top-quality,
open-sourced and academically-run infrastructure.

By building the machines and leaving the keys in the hands of academia, we intend
to provide scientists worldwide with a healthier publishing and evaluation workflow,
free of profiteering or further non-scientific interests.

To see the concrete results of our activities, start with a visit to our main site
at `scipost.org <https://scipost.org>`_.
Our guiding principles are listed on our `about page <https://scipost.org/about>`_.
You should also, at least once in your life, familiarize yourself with
our academically healthy `business model <https://scipost.org/finances/business_model/>`_.

This document is meant for good-willed geeks, techies and the plain curious.
You will find here a description of the assets and facilities we are building
to turn our vision into reality, most importantly:

- :doc:`codebase documentation <codebase/index>`
  for the software layer at the heart of our
  website `scipost.org <https://scipost.org>`_

- :doc:`deployment information <deployment/index>`
  describing how everything is practically set up
  and the workflows to keep everything in top shape.

You will also find some extra basic information about
the :doc:`SciPost Foundation <foundation/index>`
and :doc:`the infrastructure team <team>`.
