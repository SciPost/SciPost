Welcome to SciPost's infrastructure documentation!


What is SciPost?
================

The `SciPost <https://scipost.org>`_ project aims to transform academic publishing
through the creation, operation and maintenance of a full-fledged, top-quality,
open-sourced and academically-run infrastructure.

By building the machines and leaving the keys in the hands of academia, we intend
to provide scientists worldwide with a healthier publishing and evaluation workflow,
free of profiteering or further non-scientific interests.


Who are these pages intended for?
=================================

The documents listed here are primarily meant for good-willed geeks,
techies or the plain curious.

Perhaps you are an academic and want to see the insides of what we've
built for you and your community.
Perhaps you happen to be a good web developer who feels like helping out.
Perhaps you are one of our potential sponsors and want to check out how we do
things, and how transparent our activities really are.
Perhaps you are working for an organization which feels threatened by
what we do, how we do it, and where it is all going.

In all cases, in the spirit of openness and because sunshine is the best disinfectant,
you are welcome to have a look!


What you *will not* find here
=============================

These pages do not explain our actual mission in detail, nor do they display the
results of our publishing (and related) activities.

To see these, the best is to start with a visit to our main site
at `scipost.org <https://scipost.org>`_.
Our guiding principles are listed on our `about page <https://scipost.org/about>`_.
You should also familiarize yourself with our healthy and cost-slashing
`business model <https://scipost.org/finances/business_model/>`_
supported by our academic `sponsors <https://scipost.org/sponsors/>`_.



What you *will* find here
=========================

These pages start with some basic information about
the :doc:`SciPost Foundation <foundation/index>`
and :doc:`the infrastructure team <team>`.

Most importantly, you will here find a description of the assets and facilities
we are building to turn our vision for the future of publishing into reality:

- :doc:`codebase documentation <codebase/index>`
  for the software layer at the heart of our
  website `scipost.org <https://scipost.org>`_

- :doc:`deployment information <deployment/index>`
  describing how everything is practically set up
  and the workflows we implement to keep our setup in good shape.
