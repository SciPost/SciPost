******************************
SciPost's Infrastructure Teams
******************************

This page details who carries what responsibility as far as SciPost's
underlying web-based infrastructure is concerned.


Keyholders
==========

Keyholders by definition possess
all the credentials necessary to access, run and maintain all elements
of SciPost's critical infrastructure, in particular:

* production servers access
* production databases keys
* mailboxes passwords

Credentials for all necessary external services (such as
`Crossref <https://crossref.org>`_ for metadata deposition and maintenance,
`CLOCKSS <https://clockss.org>`_ for archiving, ...) are accessible to
keyholders via their production server access rights.

The set of keyholders is as small as possible to guarantee security,
and as large as necessary to ensure perennial availability of our services.

Our major, long-term sponsors can nominate one or more of their staff members to
be Keyholders.

Current Keyholders:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam]
* Jorran de Wit (jorrandewit@scipost.org)


Deployment Team
===============

Members of the Deployment Team are responsible for the day-to-day
maintenance and running of all of SciPost's online infrastructure,
including bug fixes and issues tracking.

All Deployment Team members are keyholders (the inverse is not
necessarily true).

Current Deployment Team:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam]
* Jorran de Wit (jorrandewit@scipost.org)


Development Team
================

The Development Team is responsible for the codebase behind SciPost.
This includes patches and improvements to the existing code, as well as
the implementation of short-, medium- and long-term development plans.


Current Development Team:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam] (Team Leader)
* Jorran de Wit (jorrandewit@scipost.org)

If you possess professional-caliber knowledge and experience in the frameworks
which our infrastructure is based on (Django, PostgreSQL, ...) and wish to be
considered for inclusion in our core team, please get in touch with the Team Leader.
