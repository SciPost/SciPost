*******************
Infrastructure team
*******************

This page details who carries what responsibility as far as SciPost's
underlying online infrastructure is concerned.


Keyholders
==========

Keyholders by definition possess
all the credentials necessary to access, run and maintain all elements
of SciPost's infrastructure, in particular:

* servers
* databases
* mailboxes

Keyholders are also trusted with credentials for all necessary external services
used by our infrastructure.

The set of keyholders is as small as possible to ensure security,
and as large as necessary to guarantee perennial availability of our services.

Our major, long-term sponsors can nominate one or more of their staff members to
be Keyholders.

Current Keyholders:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam]
* Jorran de Wit (jorrandewit@scipost.org)


Deployment Team
===============

Members of the Deployment Team are responsible for the day-to-day
maintenance and running of all of SciPost's online infrastructure,
including bug fixes and issues tracking.

By necessity, all Deployment Team members are keyholders (the inverse is not
necessarily true).

Current Deployment Team:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam]


Development Team
================

The Development Team is responsible for building the codebase behind SciPost.
This includes patches and improvements to the existing code, as well as
the implementation of short-, medium- and long-term development plans.


Current Development Team:

* Prof. `Jean-Sébastien Caux <https://jscaux.org>`_ (jscaux@scipost.org / prof@jscaux.org / J.S.Caux@uva.nl) [University of Amsterdam] (Team Leader)

If you possess professional-caliber knowledge and experience in the frameworks
which our infrastructure is based on (Django, PostgreSQL, ...) and wish to be
considered for inclusion in our core team, please get in touch with the Team Leader.


Advisors
=================

Advisors are highly-qualified web developers offering advice on any aspect of
the codebase or its deployment.
