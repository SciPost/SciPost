Apps
====

Here is a list of all the apps within the codebase, arranged in
broad categories according to their main purpose (these categories only
serve documentation purposes and are not used in the codebase).

Note that the apps are greatly interdependent; for example, our editorial processing
makes use of most apps, and our metadata handling
relies on a variety of information processed through a number of different apps.
The best way to map out these interdependencies is simply to dive into the code itself.

For each app listed here, we provide a separate page listing all the important modules
in that app. Going further, for each module, you will find a page displaying
the documentation generated from the docstrings in the code.
