Apps
====

Here is a list of all the apps within the codebase, broadly arranged according
to their main purpose.

Note that the apps are greatly interdependent; for example, our editorial processing
makes use of most apps, and our metadata handling
relies on a variety of information processed through a number of different apps.
The best way to map out these interdependencies is simply to dive into the code.
