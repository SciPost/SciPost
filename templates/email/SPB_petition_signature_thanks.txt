Many thanks for signing the petition!\n\n
If you have not done so already, you can really further help SciPost convince
your institution, library and/or funding agency to become Supporting Partners
by sending a personalized email to one of their representatives; we have a
handy email template for you to use at https://scipost.org/partners/.\n\n
You can also point them to our prospectus and draft agreement on that same
page.\n\nWe are very grateful for your help.\n\nThe SciPost Team
