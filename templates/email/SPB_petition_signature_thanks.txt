Many thanks for signing the petition!\n\n
One quick and easy way to help us further is to get your colleagues to also sign. We'd be grateful if you considered doing this, via word-of-mouth or email!\n\n
One less quick but even more effective way to further help SciPost convince your institution, library and/or funding agency to become Supporting Partners is to send a personalized email to one of their representatives; we have a handy email template for you to use at https://scipost.org/partners/.\n\n
You can also point them to our prospectus and draft agreement on that same
page.\n\nWe are very grateful for your help.\n\nThe SciPost Team
