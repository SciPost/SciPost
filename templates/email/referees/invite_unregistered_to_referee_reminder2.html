<p>
  Dear {{ invitation.get_title_display }} {{ invitation.last_name }},
</p>
<p>
  Recently, on behalf of the Editor-in-charge {{ invitation.submission.editor_in_charge.get_title_display }} {{ invitation.submission.editor_in_charge.user.last_name }}, we invited you to consider refereeing a Submission to {{ invitation.submission.get_submitted_to_journal_display }}, namely<br><br>
    {{ invitation.submission.title }}<br>
    by {{ invitation.submission.author_list }}<br>
    (see https://scipost.org{{ invitation.submission.get_absolute_url }} - first submitted {{ invitation.submission.original_submission_date|date:"d M Y" }}).
</p>
<p>
  We are still awaiting your response to this invitation.
  To ensure timely processing of the submission (out of respect for the authors),
  could you please let us know whether we can count on your expertise?

  If you are able to provide a Report, you can confirm this after registering and logging in (you will automatically be prompted for a confirmation).
