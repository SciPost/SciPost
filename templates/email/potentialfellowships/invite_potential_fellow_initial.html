<p>Dear {{ potfel.profile.get_title_display }} {{ potfel.profile.last_name }},</p>

<p>Hopefully you've already come across <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:index' %}">SciPost</a> and are aware of our mission to establish a community-based infrastructure for scientific publishing.</p>

<p>On behalf of the SciPost Foundation and in view of your professional expertise and reputation, I hereby would like to invite you to join our Editorial College by becoming one of our Editorial Fellows.</p>

<p>
  Academic reputation is the most important criterion guiding our considerations of who should belong to the Editorial College. The current list of Fellows can be found at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:about' %}">scipost.org/about</a>; on this page, you will also find basic information on SciPost and its guiding principles.
</p>

<p>
  We do not pose any conditions on your involvement, and you will always remain in complete control of your level of commitment (a couple of hours per month would already be significant). Functioning of the College proceeds according to the by-laws set out at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}">scipost.org/EdCol_by-laws</a>, and a short summary of the editorial workflow can be found at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'submissions:editorial_workflow' %}">this page</a>.
</p>

<p>
  I would be very happy to provide you with more information should you require it. Could I beg you to give us a response (by replying to this email) within the next couple of weeks?
</p>

<p>
    Many thanks in advance,
</p>
<p>
    Prof. J.-S. Caux,
    on behalf of the SciPost Foundation
</p>
