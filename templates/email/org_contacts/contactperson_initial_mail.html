  Dear {% if contactperson %}{{ contactperson.get_title_display }} {{ contactperson.last_name }}{% else %}colleagues{% endif %},
</p>
<p>
  You might by now have heard of SciPost, a not-for-profit initiative aiming to bring disruptive change to academic publishing practices.
</p>
<p>
  The site is anchored at <a href="https://scipost.org">SciPost.org</a>. Many further details about SciPost, its principles, ideals and implementation can be found at the <a href="https://scipost.org/about">about page</a> and <a href="https://scipost.org/FAQ">our FAQ</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can also find a summary of how your organization has benefitted from our activities at <a href="https://scipost.org{{ contactperson.organization.get_absolute_url }}">this link</a>.
</p>
<p>
  As explained on our <a href="https://scipost.org/sponsors">Sponsors page</a>, SciPost follows a completely different funding model than traditional publishers, and provides a cost-slashing alternative to existing platforms. SciPost charges neither subscription fees, nor article processing charges; its activities are instead to be collectively financed by a worldwide consortium of Sponsors, formed by institutions and organizations which directly or indirectly benefit from SciPost’s activities.
</p>
<p>
  A short summary and reasons for your organization to become Sponsors are given in <a href="https://scipost.org/static/sponsors/SciPost_Sponsors_Board_Prospectus.pdf">our one-page prospectus</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In <a href="https://scipost.org/static/sponsors/SciPost_Sponsorship_Agreement.pdf">the agreement template</a>, you will find many more specific details about our operations, requirements and funding strategy.
</p>
<p>
  It would be a privilege to welcome your organization as a Sponsor. I am hereby contacting you to enquire whether your institution would consider joining? If you are interested, you can simply get in touch via this address (sponsors@scipost.org). I sincerely hope that SciPost will be able to count on your support.
