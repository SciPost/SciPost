Dear {{submission.editor_in_charge.get_title_display}} {{submission.editor_in_charge.last_name}},\n\n

The authors of the SciPost Submission {{submission.title}} by {{submission.author_list}} have resubmitted their manuscript.\n\n

As Editor-in-charge, you can take your editorial actions from the submission\'s <a href="{% url 'submissions:editorial_page' submission.arxiv_identifier_w_vn_nr %}">editorial page</a>
(also accessible from your <a href="{% url 'scipost:personal_page' %}">personal page</a> under the Editorial Actions tab).\n

You can either take an immediate acceptance/rejection decision, or run a new refereeing round, in which case you should now invite at least 3 referees; you might want to make sure you are aware of the detailed procedure described in the <a href="{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}">Editorial College by-laws</a>.
\n\n

Many thanks in advance for your collaboration,\n
The SciPost Team.
