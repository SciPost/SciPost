<p>
    Dear {{ object.to.get_title_display }} {{ object.to.user.last_name }},
</p>
<p>
    We have received a Submission to SciPost for which we would like you to consider becoming Editor-in-charge:
</p>
<p>
    {{ object.submission.title }}<br>
    by {{ object.submission.author_list }}
</p>

<p>
    Please visit the <a href="https://scipost.org/submissions/pool">Submissions Pool</a> in order to accept or decline (it is important for you to inform us even if you decline, since this affects the result of the pre-screening process).
</p>
<p>
  Note that this assignment request is automatically deprecated if another Fellow takes charge of this Submission or if pre-screening fails in the meantime.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks in advance for your collaboration,<br>
  The SciPost Team.
