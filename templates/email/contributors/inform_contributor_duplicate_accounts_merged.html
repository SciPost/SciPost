  Dear {{ contrib_from.duplicate_of.get_title_display }} {{ contrib_from.duplicate_of.user.last_name }},
</p>
<p>
  We noticed that you had two separate registrations at SciPost, and have consolidated your two accounts into a single active one, namely your account with username <strong>{{ contrib_from.duplicate_of.user.username }}</strong>.
</p>
<p>
  Your alternate account with username <strong>{{ contrib_from.user.username }}</strong> has been deactivated, but all the data associated to it has been transferred to your active account.
</p>
<p>
  Please get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:techsupport@scipost.org">SciPost techsupport</a> if you have any questions.
</p>
<p>
  Many thanks,
  <br><br>
  The SciPost Team
