Dear {{ submission.editor_in_charge.get_title_display }} {{ submission.editor_in_charge.user.last_name }},

The authors of the SciPost Submission

{{ submission.title }}

by {{ submission.author_list }}

have resubmitted their manuscript.

As Editor-in-charge, you can take your editorial actions from the submission\'s editorial page https://scipost.org{% url 'submissions:editorial_page' submission.preprint.identifier_w_vn_nr %},
which is also accessible from your personal page at https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:personal_page' %} under the Editorial Actions tab.

You can either take an immediate acceptance/rejection decision, quickly consult previous referees or run a new refereeing round, in which case you should now invite at least 3 referees; you might want to make sure you are aware of the detailed procedure described in the Editorial College by-laws. See https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}.

Many thanks in advance for your collaboration,
The SciPost Team.
