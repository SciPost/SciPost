<p>Dear {{submission.editor_in_charge.get_title_display}} {{submission.editor_in_charge.user.last_name}},</p>

<p>
    The authors of the SciPost Submission "{{submission.title}} by {{submission.author_list}}" have resubmitted their manuscript.
</p>
<p>
    As Editor-in-charge, you can take your editorial actions from the submission\'s <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'submissions:editorial_page' submission.arxiv_identifier_w_vn_nr %}">editorial page</a>.
    (also accessible from your <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:personal_page' %}">personal page</a> under the Editorial Actions tab).
</p>
<p>
    You can either take an immediate acceptance/rejection decision, quickly consult previous referees or run a new refereeing round, in which case you should now invite at least 3 referees; you might want to make sure you are aware of the detailed procedure described in the <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}">Editorial College by-laws</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Many thanks in advance for your collaboration,<br>
    The SciPost Team.
