<p>Dear {{ prosfel.get_title_display }} {{ prosfel.last_name }},</p>
<p>Hopefully you've already come across <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:index' %}">SciPost</a> and are aware of our mission to establish a healthier infrastructure for scientific publishing.</p>
<p>On behalf of the SciPost Foundation and in view of your professional expertise and reputation, I hereby would like to invite you to join our Editorial College and become one of our Editorial Fellows. We are currently making a big push for expansion of our activities, see <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:ExpSustDrive2018' %}">this page</a> for details.</p>
<p>Please note that only well-known and respected senior academics are being contacted for this purpose. Academic reputation and involvement in the community are the most important criteria guiding our considerations of who should belong to the Editorial College. The current list of Fellows can be found at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:about' %}">scipost.org/about</a>; on this page, you will also find basic information on SciPost and its guiding principles (you can also take a look at our <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:FAQ' %}">frequently asked questions page</a>).</p>
<p>We do not pose any conditions on your involvement, and you would always remain in complete control of your level of commitment (devoting even a couple of hours per month would be enough to help out significantly). Functioning of the College proceeds according to the by-laws set out at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}">scipost.org/EdCol_by-laws</a>, and a short summary of the editorial workflow can be found at <a href="https://scipost.org{% url 'submissions:editorial_workflow' %}">this page</a>.
<p>I would be very happy to provide you with more information should you require it. Could I beg you to give us a response (by replying to this email) within the next couple of weeks?</p>
<p>Many thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Prof. J.-S. Caux, on behalf of the SciPost Foundation</p>
