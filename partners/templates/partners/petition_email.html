Dear ...%0D%0A
%0D%0A
I am writing to draw your attention to SciPost, a publishing initiative that is currently helping to transform the academic publishing industry.%0D%0A
%0D%0A
SciPost (https://scipost.org) is a top-quality next-generation Open Access publication portal managed by professional scientists. Its principles, ideals and implementation can be found at https://scipost.org/about and https://scipost.org/FAQ.%0D%0A
%0D%0A
SciPost follows a different funding model than most traditional publishers. It operates on an entirely not-for-profit basis, and charges neither subscription fees nor article processing charges; instead, its activities are financed through a cost-slashing consortial model.%0D%0A
%0D%0A
By making a small financial commitment, the institutions and organizations that benefit from SciPostâ€™s activities can become Supporting Partners. This enables SciPost to perform all of its publication-related activities, maintain its online portal and implement its long-term development plan. Details of the consortial funding scheme and how to join can be found at https://scipost.org/partners or by emailing partners@scipost.org.%0D%0A
%0D%0A
My work as an active professional scientist greatly benefits from SciPost's activities, and I recommend that you give this initiative your concrete backing by becoming one of its Supporting Partners.%0D%0A
%0D%0A
Many thanks for your consideration,%0D%0A
