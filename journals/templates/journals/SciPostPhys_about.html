            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>SciPost Physics is our flagship title in the field of Physics.</p>
	    <p>Publications in SciPost Physics provide details on groundbreaking results and significant breakthroughs occurring in any (sub)specialization of the field.</p>
	    <p>Submissions to SciPost Physics have to meet exacting editorial standards, and are subjected to our most stringent form of peer-witnessed refereeing.</p>
	    <p>Implementing <a href="{% url 'scipost:about' %}#GOA">Genuine Open Access</a>, SciPost Physics is a publishing venue in which uncompromising scientific quality meets the highest achievable standards of open accessibility.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>SciPost Physics publishes breakthrough research articles in the domains of Experimental, Theoretical and Computational physics, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul>
	      {% for discipline in subject_areas %}
	      {% if discipline.0 == 'Physics' %}
	      {% for area in discipline.1 %}

          <h2>Content</h2>
	  <p>The content format for SciPost Physics is flexible: articles can be short letter-style communications of breakthroughs or in-depth reports of groundbreaking research. There is no minimum or maximum length: the article should however represent a complete, self-contained unit. The target audience can be researchers in many different subject areas, or specialists in one.</p>
	  <p>The submission format is more demanding than in our other Journals: in addition to the main manuscript, authors must provide a two-page extended abstract detailing:
	  <ul>
	    <li>the context to the problem</li>
	    <li>the breakthrough obtained</li>
	    <li>perspectives for further research</li>
	  </ul>
	  written in a manner which is accessible to a wide spectrum of physicists (in particular for non-specialist Fellows within our Editorial College).</p>
	  <p>In addition, submissions to SciPost Physics must provide all the material needed to ensure proper reproducibility of the research results, either in appendices, adjoined files or external repository links:</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li>detailed derivations</li>
	    <li>data and code snippets used to produce figures</li>
	    <li>explicit details of experimental protocols</li>
	    <li>other types of reproducibility-facilitating material.</li>
	  </ul>
