            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>SciPost Physics Codebases is a new-generation publication venue for computer codes and algorithms of relevance to research in Physics.</p>
	    <p>It aims to offer a high-profile venue in which top-level numerical algorithms, protocols and software packages can be disseminated as fully-featured publication objects benefitting from all things expected of top-quality papers.</p>
	    <p>Contributors to research-level software development can thus obtain proper recognition and find their rightful place within modern scientific literature.</p>
	    <p>As per other SciPost Journals, SciPost Physics Codebases is two-way open access, peer-witnessed refereed. Publications in SciPost Physics Codebases benefit from the same professional treatment given to our other Journals, including metadata handling, citable DOI, citations listing, funding information handling, and permanent archiving.</p>

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h2>Scope</h2>
            <p>SciPost Physics Codebases publishes outstanding-quality Codebases relevant to all specializations in Computational, Experimental and Theoretical Physics.</p>
	    <p>Examples of publishable Codebases include:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>Novel algorithms</li>
	      <li>Significant and original reimplementations of well-known algorithms</li>
	      <li>Ports of existing codebases to new languages and platforms</li>
	    </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">
          <h2>Content</h2>
	    <p>A Codebase by definition consists of the following elements:</p>
	    <ul>
	      <li>A detailed userguide consisting of:
		<ul>
		  <li>An introduction with background information on the field of applicability of the software</li>
		  <li>A description of the generic workings of the algorithm, its novelty and added value</li>
		  <li>Installation instructions including listing of dependencies and requirements</li>

		  <li>A guide to using the software</li>
		  <li>Worked-out examples and tests for benchmarking</li>
		</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>The source code</li>
	    </ul>
	    <p>The source code itself is expected to be self-contained and to include installation instructions and benchmarking tests.</p>
