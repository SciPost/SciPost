            <h2>Aims</h2>
            <p>SciPost Physics Lecture Notes is a premium-quality, two-way open access, peer-witnessed refereed Journal for didactic material in the general field of Physics.</p>
            <p>It aims at providing scientists with a publishing platform in which uncompromising scientific quality meets the highest achievable standards of open accessibility, with a resolutely international outlook.</p>
            <p><em>Two-way open access</em> means free for readers, free for authors: there are no subscription or download costs, and authors are freed from dealing with article submission and/or processing charges.</p>
            <p>The <em>peer-witnessed refereeing</em> process guarantees high-quality, responsible refereeing, with demonstrably greater utility for authors and recognition for referees.</p>
