      <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) License</a>.
      Unless otherwise stated, any associated published material is distributed under the same license. 
      If one or more authors are US government employees, the paper can be published under the
      terms of the <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/cc0">Creative Commons CC0 public domain dedication</a>.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <h3>Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License</h3>
  <h4>You are free to</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Share</b> - copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.</li>
    <li><b>Adapt</b> - remix, transform, and build upon the material.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>for any purpose, even commercially. The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms
    as long as you follow the license terms.</p>
  <h4>Under the following terms:</h4>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Attribution</b> - You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to the
      license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any reasonable
      manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor endorses you or your use.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><b>No additional restrictions</b> - You may not apply legal terms or technological
    measures that legally restrict others from doing anything the license permits.</p>
  <h4>Notices:</h4>
  <p>You do not have to comply with the license for elements of the material in

    of the license.</h4>
  
  <h3>Copyright transfers</h3>
  <p>Many authors have strict regulations in their employment contract regarding 
    their publications. A transfer of copyright to the institution or company 
    is common as well as the reservation of specific usage rights. 
    In open-access publications in combination with the Creative Commons License, 
    a transfer of the copyright to the institution is possible as it belongs 
    to the author anyway.</p>
  
  <p>Any usage rights are regulated through the Creative Commons License. 
    As SciPost uses the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License, 
    anyone (the author, his/her institution/company, the publisher, as well 
    as the public) is free to copy, distribute, transmit, and adapt the work as 
    long as the original author is given credit (see above). Therefore, specific 
    usage rights cannot be reserved by the author or his/her institution/company, 
    and the publisher cannot include the statement "all rights reserved" 
    in any published paper.</p>
  
  <p>A copyright transfer from the author to his/her institution/company 
    can be expressed in a special "copyright statement" at the end of the 
    publication. Authors are asked to include the following sentence: 
    "The author's copyright for this publication has been transferred 
    to [institution/company]".</p>
  
  
  <h3>Reproduction requests</h3>
  <p>All articles published by SciPost are licensed under the Creative 
    Commons Attribution 4.0 License (see details above) together with 
    an author copyright. Therefore, there is no need from the publisher's 
    side to give permission for the reproduction of articles. 
    We suggest contacting the author to inform him/her about the further 
    usage of the material. However, as the author decided to publish 
    the scientific results under the CC-BY licence, he/she consented 
    to share the work under the condition that the original authors 
    be given credit.</p>
  
  <br/>
  <hr class="hr12"/>
  <h2 id="author_obligations">Author obligations</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>The primary obligation of the author(s) is to present a scientifically
      accurate account of the research performed, as concisely and objectively
      as possible, and with a discussion on its significance.</li>
    <li>A paper should contain sufficient detail and references to original
      sources of information to permit peers to reproduce the work.</li>
    <li>Conciseness should not come at the expense of scientific accuracy
      and completeness.</li>
    <li>The abstract should be comprehensive and in faithful
      correspondence to the contents of the paper.</li>
    <li>Papers must be written in English, and authors should pay 
      attention to correct spelling and grammar. Insufficient quality of
      spelling and grammar constitutes a sufficient reason for rejection.</li>
    <li>Authors should cite all publications which have been influential in
      performing the reported work, and which can orient the reader to the
      earlier work necessary to understand the reported investigation. 
      Privately obtained information (conversation, correspondence or discussion)
      should not be used or reported in the work without explicit permission
      from the originator. Information obtained while performing confidential
      services such as reporting on manuscripts or grant applications should
      be treated similarly.</li>
    <li>Fragmentation of research papers is to be avoided. Scientists should
      organize publications such that each paper gives a complete account 
      of a particular project.</li>
    <li>Authors should not submit manuscripts describing essentially the same
      research to more than one journal.</li>
    <li>Criticisms of earlier literature can be justified; personal criticism
      shall however never be considered appropriate.</li>
    <li>Only persons who have significantly contributed to the research and
      to the redaction of the manuscript should be listed as authors. The
      submitting author attests to the fact that other named authors have
      seen the final version of the paper and have agreed to its submission.
      Deceased persons who meet the criteria for co-authorship should be 
      included, with a footnote reporting the date of death. In no case should
      fictitious names be listed as co-authors. The submitter accepts the
      responsibility of having included all appropriate persons as co-authors,
      and none that are inappropriate.</li>
  </ol>

  <br/>
  <hr class="hr12"/>
  <h2 id="referee_obligations">Referee obligations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Contributors asked to referee should promptly accept or decline the 
      task assigned to them.</li>
    <li>Following acceptance, the referee should provide a report within the
      allocated refereeing period. It is preferable to deliver a shorter report
      within the expected time than no report at all.</li>
    <li>A Contributor should not referee a paper authored or co-authored by
      someone with whom the referee has a personal or professional (hierarchic)
      connection if this has the potential to bias the judgement.</li>
    <li>A Contributor should not referee a paper authored or co-authored by
      someone with whom the referee has published in the preceding three years.</li>
    <li>A Contributor should not agree to referee if there is any doubt on a
      possible conflict of interest issuing from close links between the work
      to be refereed and the Contributor's own work.</li>
    <li>A Contributor who feels insufficiently qualified to fulfill a given
      refereeing task should decline it as promptly as possible.</li>
    <li>Reports should be objective and evidence-based, and focus primarily on
      the scientific validity, significance and originality of the manuscript 
      under consideration.</li>
    <li>Judgements provided should be supported by sufficient evidence in the
      form of explanations or references to other works, in order to make them
      clearly understandable. Any claim of preexisting material must be
      accompanied with the relevant citation.</li>
    <li>A Referee should also assess the level of clarity of the manuscript,
      as well as its general formatting and level of grammar.</li>
  </ul>
