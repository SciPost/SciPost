        <p>As an Editorial Fellow, you are automatically a member of the
          Editorial College, whose detailed functioning is explained in the
          <a href="{% url 'scipost:EdCol_by-laws' %}">by-laws</a>. These include a
          detailed description of the Submissions handling process, of which this is
          a quick summary.

        <p>
          Some other important information is to be found in the

        <h3 class="highlight">Becoming Editor-in-charge of a Submission</h3>
        <p>You can become Editor-in-charge of a Submission by either:
            <ul>
                <li>accepting an assignment request (emailed to you by an Editorial Administrator)</li>
                <li>volunteering directly from the <a href="{% url 'submissions:pool' %}">
                Submissions Pool</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            For each incoming Submission, assignment requests are emailed to a handful of
            Fellows whose expertise matches that of the Submission. You are never obliged
            to accept an assignment; we do however appreciate a quick response, including a
            reason for declining (since this determines the results of the pre-screening stage:
            if five Fellows decline for lack of interest, the paper is rejected at this stage).

        <h3 class="highlight">Your tasks as an Editor-in-charge of a particular Submission</h3>

      <p>
        Once you become Editor-in-charge of a Submission, you gain access to this
        Submission's Editorial Page, containing all you need to run the editorial process.
        The online tools at your disposal are meant to make your work as Editor-in-charge
        as simple and rapid as possible. They allow you to:
        <ul>
          <li>Invite referees</li>
          <li>Communicate with authors, referees and Editorial Administrators</li>
          <li>Open/extend/close refereeing rounds</li>
          <li>Formulate your Editorial Recommendation.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a step-by-step guide to the process
        (when appropriate, you will receive emails containing relevant information
        and notifying you of any pending tasks):
      </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Upon becoming Editor-in-charge, please invite at least 3 referees</li>
          <li>If any referee declines to review, please invite a replacement</li>
          <li>If a referee does not respond after 3 days, please send a reminder (one-click)</li>
          <li>If needed, extend the refereeing round (one-click)</li>
          <li>When reports come in, please vet them</li>
          <li>Once reports have been gathered, close the refereeing round (one-click)</li>
          <li>Based on the delivered Reports and Comments, formulate your Editorial Recommendation.</li>
        </ul>
      <p>
        After you have formulated and sent your Editorial Recommendation, your tasks are fulfilled.
      </p>
      <p>
        If and when the paper is resubmitted (after minor or major modifications), the process
        starts again with you as Editor-in-charge (you can start a new refereeing round if needed,
        or immediately formulate a new Editorial Recommendation).
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
        If your Editorial Recommendation is for minor or major modification of the paper, it is
        forwarded directly to the authors. If it is to accept or reject the paper, it is forwarded
        to the Editorial College for ratification.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this point onwards, the process is carried further by the Editorial Administrators.

        <h3 class="highlight">The Editorial College</h3>

        <p>
            The binding decision on publication or rejection is taken by the Editorial College.
            Fellows receive a communication by email from the Editorial Administrators, asking
            for ratification of submitted Editorial Recommendations. Acceptance of the
            Editor-in-charge's recommendation is tacitly assumed when no response is received.

        <h3 class="highlight">Production of the published version (version of record)</h3>
        <p>
            Post-acceptance, the paper is handled by the production team, who produce the
            final version and publish it in the relevant Journal. As an Editorial Fellow,
            you carry no responsibility for any of these tasks.

        <h3 class="highlight">Commitment</h3>
        <p>
            Your involvement in the Editorial College is greatly valued, and we understand
            that your time is precious. A normal workload would be to handle a handful of
            Submissions in any calendar year. This should represent on average two to four
            hours of work per month.
