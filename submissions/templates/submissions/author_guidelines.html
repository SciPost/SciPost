    <h1>Author Guidelines</h1>
  </div>
  <p>Before submitting to SciPost, you should familiarize yourself with the 
    <a href="{% url 'journals:journals_terms_and_conditions' %}">SciPost Journals Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

  <h2>Manuscript preparation</h2>

  <p>We prefer authors to prepare their manuscript using the SciPost LaTeX template (<a href="{% static 'submissions/latex/SciPost_LaTeX_template.tex' %}">.tex</a>, <a href="{% static 'submissions/latex/SciPost_LaTeX_template.pdf' %}">.pdf example</a>).</p>
  <p>The article should contain the following elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Title
      <p>The title should ideally be 120 characters or less, and be descriptive of the research reported.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Authors
      <p>Authors should be listed by initials and last name, with superscript reference to their affiliation. 
	The corresponding author should be indicated with a superscript asterisk.</p>
    <li>Abstract
      <p>The abstract should fit within 8 lines of the template.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Bulk Sections
      <p>The bulk of the paper should be clearly divided into sections with short descriptive titles, including an introduction and a conclusion.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Figures
      <p>Figures should only occupy the stricly necessary space, in any case individually fitting on a single page. 
	Each figure item should be appropriately labeled and accompanied by a descriptive caption. 
	SciPost does not accept creative figures or artist's impressions; 
	on the other hand, technical drawings and scientifically accurate representations are encouraged.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Acknowledgements
      <p>Acknowledgements should follow immediately after the conclusion.
	Authors are required to provide funding information, including relevant agencies and grant numbers with linked author's initials.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Author contributions
      <p>Contributions should be succinctly described using author initials.</p>
    </li>
    <li>Appendices
      <p>Supplementary material which goes beyond the paper's bulk contents can be provided in appendices, which should be
	labeled using capital letters.</p>
    </li>
    <li>References
      <p>Items in the list of references should include authors, title, journal reference and most importantly
	DOI link.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>All equations and references should be hyperlinked to ensure ease of navigation.</p>
  <p>There is no strict length limitation, but the authors are strongly encouraged to keep contents to the
    strict minimum necessary for peers to reproduce the research described in the paper.</p>

  <h2>Manuscript submission</h2>
  <p>Submitting your manuscript to SciPost is extremely easy. You should:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Make your preprint publicly available on <a href="http://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a></li>
    <li>After appearance on arxiv.org, fill the SciPost <a href="{% url 'submissions:submit_manuscript' %}">Submission</a> form, selecting which SciPost Journal 
      to submit to and providing domain and speciality specifications.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>By submitting your manuscript, you assert that you have read and agree with the 
    <a href="{% url 'journals:journals_terms_and_conditions' %}">SciPost Journals Terms and Conditions</a>.</p>

  <p>At the moment of submission, you will have the chance to provide names of editors or referees which
    you would prefer to exclude from the peer evaluation of your manuscript. The Editorial College will
    make every reasonable effort to implement such requests, except in cases where this is interpreted as
    interfering with a rigorous assessment of the work.</p>
